      CHAPTER I. AN INVITATION FOR TOM AND HUCK

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Note: Strange as the incidents of this story are, they
     are not inventions, but facts&mdash;even to the public confession
     of the accused.  I take them from an old-time Swedish
     criminal trial, change the actors, and transfer the scenes
     to America.  I have added some details, but only a couple of
     them are important ones. &mdash; M. T.]
</pre>
    <p>
      WELL, it was the next spring after me and Tom Sawyer set our old nigger
      Jim free, the time he was chained up for a runaway slave down there on
      Tom&rsquo;s uncle Silas&rsquo;s farm in Arkansaw. The frost was working out of the
      ground, and out of the air, too, and it was getting closer and closer onto
      barefoot time every day; and next it would be marble time, and next
      mumbletypeg, and next tops and hoops, and next kites, and then right away
      it would be summer and going in a-swimming. It just makes a boy homesick
      to look ahead like that and see how far off summer is. Yes, and it sets
      him to sighing and saddening around, and there&rsquo;s something the matter with
      him, he don&rsquo;t know what. But anyway, he gets out by himself and mopes and
      thinks; and mostly he hunts for a lonesome place high up on the hill in
      the edge of the woods, and sets there and looks away off on the big
      Mississippi down there a-reaching miles and miles around the points where
      the timber looks smoky and dim it&rsquo;s so far off and still, and everything&rsquo;s
      so solemn it seems like everybody you&rsquo;ve loved is dead and gone, and you
      &rsquo;most wish you was dead and gone too, and done with it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don&rsquo;t you know what that is? It&rsquo;s spring fever. That is what the name of
      it is. And when you&rsquo;ve got it, you want&mdash;oh, you don&rsquo;t quite know
      what it is you DO want, but it just fairly makes your heart ache, you want
      it so! It seems to you that mainly what you want is to get away; get away
      from the same old tedious things you&rsquo;re so used to seeing and so tired of,
      and set something new. That is the idea; you want to go and be a wanderer;
      you want to go wandering far away to strange countries where everything is
      mysterious and wonderful and romantic. And if you can&rsquo;t do that, you&rsquo;ll
      put up with considerable less; you&rsquo;ll go anywhere you CAN go, just so as
      to get away, and be thankful of the chance, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, me and Tom Sawyer had the spring fever, and had it bad, too; but it
      warn&rsquo;t any use to think about Tom trying to get away, because, as he said,
      his Aunt Polly wouldn&rsquo;t let him quit school and go traipsing off somers
      wasting time; so we was pretty blue. We was setting on the front steps one
      day about sundown talking this way, when out comes his aunt Polly with a
      letter in her hand and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, I reckon you&rsquo;ve got to pack up and go down to Arkansaw&mdash;your
      aunt Sally wants you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I &rsquo;most jumped out of my skin for joy. I reckoned Tom would fly at his
      aunt and hug her head off; but if you believe me he set there like a rock,
      and never said a word. It made me fit to cry to see him act so foolish,
      with such a noble chance as this opening up. Why, we might lose it if he
      didn&rsquo;t speak up and show he was thankful and grateful. But he set there
      and studied and studied till I was that distressed I didn&rsquo;t know what to
      do; then he says, very ca&rsquo;m, and I could a shot him for it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right down sorry, Aunt Polly, but I reckon I got to
      be excused&mdash;for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His aunt Polly was knocked so stupid and so mad at the cold impudence of
      it that she couldn&rsquo;t say a word for as much as a half a minute, and this
      gave me a chance to nudge Tom and whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you got any sense? Sp&rsquo;iling such a noble chance as this and
      throwing it away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he warn&rsquo;t disturbed. He mumbled back:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huck Finn, do you want me to let her SEE how bad I want to go? Why, she&rsquo;d
      begin to doubt, right away, and imagine a lot of sicknesses and dangers
      and objections, and first you know she&rsquo;d take it all back. You lemme
      alone; I reckon I know how to work her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now I never would &rsquo;a&rsquo; thought of that. But he was right. Tom Sawyer was
      always right&mdash;the levelest head I ever see, and always AT himself and
      ready for anything you might spring on him. By this time his aunt Polly
      was all straight again, and she let fly. She says:
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0181}.jpg" alt="{0181}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0181}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be excused! YOU will! Well, I never heard the like of it in all my
      days! The idea of you talking like that to ME! Now take yourself off and
      pack your traps; and if I hear another word out of you about what you&rsquo;ll
      be excused from and what you won&rsquo;t, I lay I&rsquo;LL excuse you&mdash;with a
      hickory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hit his head a thump with her thimble as we dodged by, and he let on
      to be whimpering as we struck for the stairs. Up in his room he hugged me,
      he was so out of his head for gladness because he was going traveling. And
      he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before we get away she&rsquo;ll wish she hadn&rsquo;t let me go, but she won&rsquo;t know
      any way to get around it now. After what she&rsquo;s said, her pride won&rsquo;t let
      her take it back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom was packed in ten minutes, all except what his aunt and Mary would
      finish up for him; then we waited ten more for her to get cooled down and
      sweet and gentle again; for Tom said it took her ten minutes to unruffle
      in times when half of her feathers was up, but twenty when they was all
      up, and this was one of the times when they was all up. Then we went down,
      being in a sweat to know what the letter said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was setting there in a brown study, with it laying in her lap. We set
      down, and she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re in considerable trouble down there, and they think you and
      Huck&rsquo;ll be a kind of diversion for them&mdash;&rsquo;comfort,&rsquo; they say. Much of
      that they&rsquo;ll get out of you and Huck Finn, I reckon. There&rsquo;s a neighbor
      named Brace Dunlap that&rsquo;s been wanting to marry their Benny for three
      months, and at last they told him point blank and once for all, he
      COULDN&rsquo;T; so he has soured on them, and they&rsquo;re worried about it. I reckon
      he&rsquo;s somebody they think they better be on the good side of, for they&rsquo;ve
      tried to please him by hiring his no-account brother to help on the farm
      when they can&rsquo;t hardly afford it, and don&rsquo;t want him around anyhow. Who
      are the Dunlaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They live about a mile from Uncle Silas&rsquo;s place, Aunt Polly&mdash;all the
      farmers live about a mile apart down there&mdash;and Brace Dunlap is a
      long sight richer than any of the others, and owns a whole grist of
      niggers. He&rsquo;s a widower, thirty-six years old, without any children, and
      is proud of his money and overbearing, and everybody is a little afraid of
      him. I judge he thought he could have any girl he wanted, just for the
      asking, and it must have set him back a good deal when he found he
      couldn&rsquo;t get Benny. Why, Benny&rsquo;s only half as old as he is, and just as
      sweet and lovely as&mdash;well, you&rsquo;ve seen her. Poor old Uncle Silas&mdash;why,
      it&rsquo;s pitiful, him trying to curry favor that way&mdash;so hard pushed and
      poor, and yet hiring that useless Jubiter Dunlap to please his ornery
      brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a name&mdash;Jubiter! Where&rsquo;d he get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only just a nickname. I reckon they&rsquo;ve forgot his real name long
      before this. He&rsquo;s twenty-seven, now, and has had it ever since the first
      time he ever went in swimming. The school teacher seen a round brown mole
      the size of a dime on his left leg above his knee, and four little bits of
      moles around it, when he was naked, and he said it minded him of Jubiter
      and his moons; and the children thought it was funny, and so they got to
      calling him Jubiter, and he&rsquo;s Jubiter yet. He&rsquo;s tall, and lazy, and sly,
      and sneaky, and ruther cowardly, too, but kind of good-natured, and wears
      long brown hair and no beard, and hasn&rsquo;t got a cent, and Brace boards him
      for nothing, and gives him his old clothes to wear, and despises him.
      Jubiter is a twin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s t&rsquo;other twin like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just exactly like Jubiter&mdash;so they say; used to was, anyway, but he
      hain&rsquo;t been seen for seven years. He got to robbing when he was nineteen
      or twenty, and they jailed him; but he broke jail and got away&mdash;up
      North here, somers. They used to hear about him robbing and burglaring now
      and then, but that was years ago. He&rsquo;s dead, now. At least that&rsquo;s what
      they say. They don&rsquo;t hear about him any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There wasn&rsquo;t anything more said for a considerable while; the old lady was
      thinking. At last she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing that is mostly worrying your aunt Sally is the tempers that
      that man Jubiter gets your uncle into.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom was astonished, and so was I. Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tempers? Uncle Silas? Land, you must be joking! I didn&rsquo;t know he HAD any
      temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Works him up into perfect rages, your aunt Sally says; says he acts as if
      he would really hit the man, sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Polly, it beats anything I ever heard of. Why, he&rsquo;s just as gentle
      as mush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s worried, anyway. Says your uncle Silas is like a changed man,
      on account of all this quarreling. And the neighbors talk about it, and
      lay all the blame on your uncle, of course, because he&rsquo;s a preacher and
      hain&rsquo;t got any business to quarrel. Your aunt Sally says he hates to go
      into the pulpit he&rsquo;s so ashamed; and the people have begun to cool toward
      him, and he ain&rsquo;t as popular now as he used to was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t it strange? Why, Aunt Polly, he was always so good and kind
      and moony and absent-minded and chuckle-headed and lovable&mdash;why, he
      was just an angel! What CAN be the matter of him, do you reckon?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. JAKE DUNLAP
    </h2>
    <p>
      WE had powerful good luck; because we got a chance in a stern-wheeler from
      away North which was bound for one of them bayous or one-horse rivers away
      down Louisiana way, and so we could go all the way down the Upper
      Mississippi and all the way down the Lower Mississippi to that farm in
      Arkansaw without having to change steamboats at St. Louis; not so very
      much short of a thousand miles at one pull.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pretty lonesome boat; there warn&rsquo;t but few passengers, and all old
      folks, that set around, wide apart, dozing, and was very quiet. We was
      four days getting out of the &ldquo;upper river,&rdquo; because we got aground so
      much. But it warn&rsquo;t dull&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t be for boys that was traveling, of
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the very start me and Tom allowed that there was somebody sick in the
      stateroom next to ourn, because the meals was always toted in there by the
      waiters. By and by we asked about it&mdash;Tom did and the waiter said it
      was a man, but he didn&rsquo;t look sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but AIN&rsquo;T he sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; maybe he is, but &rsquo;pears to me he&rsquo;s just letting on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because if he was sick he would pull his clothes off SOME time or other&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you reckon he would? Well, this one don&rsquo;t. At least he don&rsquo;t ever pull off
      his boots, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mischief he don&rsquo;t! Not even when he goes to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was always nuts for Tom Sawyer&mdash;a mystery was. If you&rsquo;d lay out a
      mystery and a pie before me and him, you wouldn&rsquo;t have to say take your
      choice; it was a thing that would regulate itself. Because in my nature I
      have always run to pie, whilst in his nature he has always run to mystery.
      People are made different. And it is the best way. Tom says to the waiter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the man&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phillips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d he come aboard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he got aboard at Elexandria, up on the Iowa line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you reckon he&rsquo;s a-playing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t any notion&mdash;I never thought of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I says to myself, here&rsquo;s another one that runs to pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything peculiar about him?&mdash;the way he acts or talks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;nothing, except he seems so scary, and keeps his doors locked
      night and day both, and when you knock he won&rsquo;t let you in till he opens
      the door a crack and sees who it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By jimminy, it&rsquo;s int&rsquo;resting! I&rsquo;d like to get a look at him. Say&mdash;the
      next time you&rsquo;re going in there, don&rsquo;t you reckon you could spread the
      door and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeedy! He&rsquo;s always behind it. He would block that game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom studied over it, and then he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looky here. You lend me your apern and let me take him his breakfast in
      the morning. I&rsquo;ll give you a quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy was plenty willing enough, if the head steward wouldn&rsquo;t mind. Tom
      says that&rsquo;s all right, he reckoned he could fix it with the head steward;
      and he done it. He fixed it so as we could both go in with aperns on and
      toting vittles.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t sleep much, he was in such a sweat to get in there and find out
      the mystery about Phillips; and moreover he done a lot of guessing about
      it all night, which warn&rsquo;t no use, for if you are going to find out the
      facts of a thing, what&rsquo;s the sense in guessing out what ain&rsquo;t the facts
      and wasting ammunition? I didn&rsquo;t lose no sleep. I wouldn&rsquo;t give a dern to
      know what&rsquo;s the matter of Phillips, I says to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, in the morning we put on the aperns and got a couple of trays of
      truck, and Tom he knocked on the door. The man opened it a crack, and then
      he let us in and shut it quick. By Jackson, when we got a sight of him, we
      &rsquo;most dropped the trays! and Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Jubiter Dunlap, where&rsquo;d YOU come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, the man was astonished, of course; and first off he looked like he
      didn&rsquo;t know whether to be scared, or glad, or both, or which, but finally
      he settled down to being glad; and then his color come back, though at
      first his face had turned pretty white. So we got to talking together
      while he et his breakfast. And he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I aint Jubiter Dunlap. I&rsquo;d just as soon tell you who I am, though, if
      you&rsquo;ll swear to keep mum, for I ain&rsquo;t no Phillips, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep mum, but there ain&rsquo;t any need to tell who you are if you ain&rsquo;t
      Jubiter Dunlap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because if you ain&rsquo;t him you&rsquo;re t&rsquo;other twin, Jake. You&rsquo;re the spit&rsquo;n
      image of Jubiter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m Jake. But looky here, how do you come to know us Dunlaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom told about the adventures we&rsquo;d had down there at his uncle Silas&rsquo;s
      last summer, and when he see that there warn&rsquo;t anything about his folks&mdash;or
      him either, for that matter&mdash;that we didn&rsquo;t know, he opened out and
      talked perfectly free and candid. He never made any bones about his own
      case; said he&rsquo;d been a hard lot, was a hard lot yet, and reckoned he&rsquo;d be
      a hard lot plumb to the end. He said of course it was a dangerous life,
      and&mdash;He give a kind of gasp, and set his head like a person that&rsquo;s
      listening. We didn&rsquo;t say anything, and so it was very still for a second
      or so, and there warn&rsquo;t no sounds but the screaking of the woodwork and
      the chug-chugging of the machinery down below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we got him comfortable again, telling him about his people, and how
      Brace&rsquo;s wife had been dead three years, and Brace wanted to marry Benny
      and she shook him, and Jubiter was working for Uncle Silas, and him and
      Uncle Silas quarreling all the time&mdash;and then he let go and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land!&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like old times to hear all this tittle-tattle, and
      does me good. It&rsquo;s been seven years and more since I heard any. How do
      they talk about me these days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The farmers&mdash;and the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, they don&rsquo;t talk about you at all&mdash;at least only just a mention,
      once in a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nation!&rdquo; he says, surprised; &ldquo;why is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they think you are dead long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Are you speaking true?&mdash;honor bright, now.&rdquo; He jumped up,
      excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honor bright. There ain&rsquo;t anybody thinks you are alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m saved, I&rsquo;m saved, sure! I&rsquo;ll go home. They&rsquo;ll hide me and save
      my life. You keep mum. Swear you&rsquo;ll keep mum&mdash;swear you&rsquo;ll never,
      never tell on me. Oh, boys, be good to a poor devil that&rsquo;s being hunted
      day and night, and dasn&rsquo;t show his face! I&rsquo;ve never done you any harm;
      I&rsquo;ll never do you any, as God is in the heavens; swear you&rsquo;ll be good to
      me and help me save my life.&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0189}.jpg" alt="{0189}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0189}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      We&rsquo;d a swore it if he&rsquo;d been a dog; and so we done it. Well, he couldn&rsquo;t
      love us enough for it or be grateful enough, poor cuss; it was all he
      could do to keep from hugging us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We talked along, and he got out a little hand-bag and begun to open it,
      and told us to turn our backs. We done it, and when he told us to turn
      again he was perfectly different to what he was before. He had on blue
      goggles and the naturalest-looking long brown whiskers and mustashes you
      ever see. His own mother wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; knowed him. He asked us if he looked
      like his brother Jubiter, now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Tom said; &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t anything left that&rsquo;s like him except the long
      hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll get that cropped close to my head before I get there;
      then him and Brace will keep my secret, and I&rsquo;ll live with them as being a
      stranger, and the neighbors won&rsquo;t ever guess me out. What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom he studied awhile, then he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course me and Huck are going to keep mum there, but if you don&rsquo;t
      keep mum yourself there&rsquo;s going to be a little bit of a risk&mdash;it
      ain&rsquo;t much, maybe, but it&rsquo;s a little. I mean, if you talk, won&rsquo;t people
      notice that your voice is just like Jubiter&rsquo;s; and mightn&rsquo;t it make them
      think of the twin they reckoned was dead, but maybe after all was hid all
      this time under another name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a sharp one! You&rsquo;re perfectly right. I&rsquo;ve
      got to play deef and dumb when there&rsquo;s a neighbor around. If I&rsquo;d a struck
      for home and forgot that little detail&mdash;However, I wasn&rsquo;t striking
      for home. I was breaking for any place where I could get away from these
      fellows that are after me; then I was going to put on this disguise and
      get some different clothes, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped for the outside door and laid his ear against it and listened,
      pale and kind of panting. Presently he whispers:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounded like cocking a gun! Lord, what a life to lead!&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0193}.jpg" alt="{0193}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0193}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      Then he sunk down in a chair all limp and sick like, and wiped the sweat
      off of his face.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. A DIAMOND ROBBERY
    </h2>
    <p>
      FROM that time out, we was with him &rsquo;most all the time, and one or t&rsquo;other
      of us slept in his upper berth. He said he had been so lonesome, and it
      was such a comfort to him to have company, and somebody to talk to in his
      troubles. We was in a sweat to find out what his secret was, but Tom said
      the best way was not to seem anxious, then likely he would drop into it
      himself in one of his talks, but if we got to asking questions he would
      get suspicious and shet up his shell. It turned out just so. It warn&rsquo;t no
      trouble to see that he WANTED to talk about it, but always along at first
      he would scare away from it when he got on the very edge of it, and go to
      talking about something else. The way it come about was this: He got to
      asking us, kind of indifferent like, about the passengers down on deck. We
      told him about them. But he warn&rsquo;t satisfied; we warn&rsquo;t particular enough.
      He told us to describe them better. Tom done it. At last, when Tom was
      describing one of the roughest and raggedest ones, he gave a shiver and a
      gasp and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, lordy, that&rsquo;s one of them! They&rsquo;re aboard sure&mdash;I just knowed
      it. I sort of hoped I had got away, but I never believed it. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently when Tom was describing another mangy, rough deck passenger, he
      give that shiver again and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s him!&mdash;that&rsquo;s the other one. If it would only come a good
      black stormy night and I could get ashore. You see, they&rsquo;ve got spies on
      me. They&rsquo;ve got a right to come up and buy drinks at the bar yonder
      forrard, and they take that chance to bribe somebody to keep watch on me&mdash;porter
      or boots or somebody. If I was to slip ashore without anybody seeing me,
      they would know it inside of an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So then he got to wandering along, and pretty soon, sure enough, he was
      telling! He was poking along through his ups and downs, and when he come
      to that place he went right along. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a confidence game. We played it on a julery-shop in St. Louis.
      What we was after was a couple of noble big di&rsquo;monds as big as hazel-nuts,
      which everybody was running to see. We was dressed up fine, and we played
      it on them in broad daylight. We ordered the di&rsquo;monds sent to the hotel
      for us to see if we wanted to buy, and when we was examining them we had
      paste counterfeits all ready, and THEM was the things that went back to
      the shop when we said the water wasn&rsquo;t quite fine enough for twelve
      thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve-thousand-dollars!&rdquo; Tom says. &ldquo;Was they really worth all that
      money, do you reckon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every cent of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you fellows got away with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As easy as nothing. I don&rsquo;t reckon the julery people know they&rsquo;ve been
      robbed yet. But it wouldn&rsquo;t be good sense to stay around St. Louis, of
      course, so we considered where we&rsquo;d go. One was for going one way, one
      another, so we throwed up, heads or tails, and the Upper Mississippi won.
      We done up the di&rsquo;monds in a paper and put our names on it and put it in
      the keep of the hotel clerk, and told him not to ever let either of us
      have it again without the others was on hand to see it done; then we went
      down town, each by his own self&mdash;because I reckon maybe we all had
      the same notion. I don&rsquo;t know for certain, but I reckon maybe we had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What notion?&rdquo; Tom says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To rob the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;one take everything, after all of you had helped to get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cert&rsquo;nly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It disgusted Tom Sawyer, and he said it was the orneriest, low-downest
      thing he ever heard of. But Jake Dunlap said it warn&rsquo;t unusual in the
      profession. Said when a person was in that line of business he&rsquo;d got to
      look out for his own intrust, there warn&rsquo;t nobody else going to do it for
      him. And then he went on. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, the trouble was, you couldn&rsquo;t divide up two di&rsquo;monds amongst
      three. If there&rsquo;d been three&mdash;But never mind about that, there warn&rsquo;t
      three. I loafed along the back streets studying and studying. And I says
      to myself, I&rsquo;ll hog them di&rsquo;monds the first chance I get, and I&rsquo;ll have a
      disguise all ready, and I&rsquo;ll give the boys the slip, and when I&rsquo;m safe
      away I&rsquo;ll put it on, and then let them find me if they can. So I got the
      false whiskers and the goggles and this countrified suit of clothes, and
      fetched them along back in a hand-bag; and when I was passing a shop where
      they sell all sorts of things, I got a glimpse of one of my pals through
      the window. It was Bud Dixon. I was glad, you bet. I says to myself, I&rsquo;ll
      see what he buys. So I kept shady, and watched. Now what do you reckon it
      was he bought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whiskers?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goggles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, keep still, Huck Finn, can&rsquo;t you, you&rsquo;re only just hendering all you
      can. What WAS it he bought, Jake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d never guess in the world. It was only just a screwdriver&mdash;just
      a wee little bit of a screwdriver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I declare! What did he want with that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought. It was curious. It clean stumped me. I says to
      myself, what can he want with that thing? Well, when he come out I stood
      back out of sight, and then tracked him to a second-hand slop-shop and see
      him buy a red flannel shirt and some old ragged clothes&mdash;just the
      ones he&rsquo;s got on now, as you&rsquo;ve described. Then I went down to the wharf
      and hid my things aboard the up-river boat that we had picked out, and
      then started back and had another streak of luck. I seen our other pal lay
      in HIS stock of old rusty second-handers. We got the di&rsquo;monds and went
      aboard the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now we was up a stump, for we couldn&rsquo;t go to bed. We had to set up
      and watch one another. Pity, that was; pity to put that kind of a strain
      on us, because there was bad blood between us from a couple of weeks back,
      and we was only friends in the way of business. Bad anyway, seeing there
      was only two di&rsquo;monds betwixt three men. First we had supper, and then
      tramped up and down the deck together smoking till most midnight; then we
      went and set down in my stateroom and locked the doors and looked in the
      piece of paper to see if the di&rsquo;monds was all right, then laid it on the
      lower berth right in full sight; and there we set, and set, and by-and-by
      it got to be dreadful hard to keep awake. At last Bud Dixon he dropped
      off. As soon as he was snoring a good regular gait that was likely to
      last, and had his chin on his breast and looked permanent, Hal Clayton
      nodded towards the di&rsquo;monds and then towards the outside door, and I
      understood. I reached and got the paper, and then we stood up and waited
      perfectly still; Bud never stirred; I turned the key of the outside door
      very soft and slow, then turned the knob the same way, and we went
      tiptoeing out onto the guard, and shut the door very soft and gentle.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0199}.jpg" alt="{0199}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0199}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;There warn&rsquo;t nobody stirring anywhere, and the boat was slipping along,
      swift and steady, through the big water in the smoky moonlight. We never
      said a word, but went straight up onto the hurricane-deck and plumb back
      aft, and set down on the end of the sky-light. Both of us knowed what that
      meant, without having to explain to one another. Bud Dixon would wake up
      and miss the swag, and would come straight for us, for he ain&rsquo;t afeard of
      anything or anybody, that man ain&rsquo;t. He would come, and we would heave him
      overboard, or get killed trying. It made me shiver, because I ain&rsquo;t as
      brave as some people, but if I showed the white feather&mdash;well, I
      knowed better than do that. I kind of hoped the boat would land somers,
      and we could skip ashore and not have to run the risk of this row, I was
      so scared of Bud Dixon, but she was an upper-river tub and there warn&rsquo;t no
      real chance of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the time strung along and along, and that fellow never come! Why,
      it strung along till dawn begun to break, and still he never come.
      &lsquo;Thunder,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;what do you make out of this?&mdash;ain&rsquo;t it
      suspicious?&rsquo; &lsquo;Land!&rsquo; Hal says, &lsquo;do you reckon he&rsquo;s playing us?&mdash;open
      the paper!&rsquo; I done it, and by gracious there warn&rsquo;t anything in it but a
      couple of little pieces of loaf-sugar! THAT&rsquo;S the reason he could set
      there and snooze all night so comfortable. Smart? Well, I reckon! He had
      had them two papers all fixed and ready, and he had put one of them in
      place of t&rsquo;other right under our noses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We felt pretty cheap. But the thing to do, straight off, was to make a
      plan; and we done it. We would do up the paper again, just as it was, and
      slip in, very elaborate and soft, and lay it on the bunk again, and let on
      WE didn&rsquo;t know about any trick, and hadn&rsquo;t any idea he was a-laughing at
      us behind them bogus snores of his&rsquo;n; and we would stick by him, and the
      first night we was ashore we would get him drunk and search him, and get
      the di&rsquo;monds; and DO for him, too, if it warn&rsquo;t too risky. If we got the
      swag, we&rsquo;d GOT to do for him, or he would hunt us down and do for us,
      sure. But I didn&rsquo;t have no real hope. I knowed we could get him drunk&mdash;he
      was always ready for that&mdash;but what&rsquo;s the good of it? You might
      search him a year and never find&mdash;Well, right there I catched my
      breath and broke off my thought! For an idea went ripping through my head
      that tore my brains to rags&mdash;and land, but I felt gay and good! You
      see, I had had my boots off, to unswell my feet, and just then I took up
      one of them to put it on, and I catched a glimpse of the heel-bottom, and
      it just took my breath away. You remember about that puzzlesome little
      screwdriver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet I do,&rdquo; says Tom, all excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when I catched that glimpse of that boot heel, the idea that went
      smashing through my head was, I know where he&rsquo;s hid the di&rsquo;monds! You look
      at this boot heel, now. See, it&rsquo;s bottomed with a steel plate, and the
      plate is fastened on with little screws. Now there wasn&rsquo;t a screw about
      that feller anywhere but in his boot heels; so, if he needed a
      screwdriver, I reckoned I knowed why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huck, ain&rsquo;t it bully!&rdquo; says Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I got my boots on, and we went down and slipped in and laid the
      paper of sugar on the berth, and sat down soft and sheepish and went to
      listening to Bud Dixon snore. Hal Clayton dropped off pretty soon, but I
      didn&rsquo;t; I wasn&rsquo;t ever so wide awake in my life. I was spying out from
      under the shade of my hat brim, searching the floor for leather. It took
      me a long time, and I begun to think maybe my guess was wrong, but at last
      I struck it. It laid over by the bulkhead, and was nearly the color of the
      carpet. It was a little round plug about as thick as the end of your
      little finger, and I says to myself there&rsquo;s a di&rsquo;mond in the nest you&rsquo;ve
      come from. Before long I spied out the plug&rsquo;s mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of the smartness and coolness of that blatherskite! He put up that
      scheme on us and reasoned out what we would do, and we went ahead and done
      it perfectly exact, like a couple of pudd&rsquo;nheads. He set there and took
      his own time to unscrew his heelplates and cut out his plugs and stick in
      the di&rsquo;monds and screw on his plates again. He allowed we would steal the
      bogus swag and wait all night for him to come up and get drownded, and by
      George it&rsquo;s just what we done! I think it was powerful smart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet your life it was!&rdquo; says Tom, just full of admiration.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE THREE SLEEPERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      WELL, all day we went through the humbug of watching one another, and it
      was pretty sickly business for two of us and hard to act out, I can tell
      you. About night we landed at one of them little Missouri towns high up
      toward Iowa, and had supper at the tavern, and got a room upstairs with a
      cot and a double bed in it, but I dumped my bag under a deal table in the
      dark hall while we was moving along it to bed, single file, me last, and
      the landlord in the lead with a tallow candle. We had up a lot of whisky,
      and went to playing high-low-jack for dimes, and as soon as the whisky
      begun to take hold of Bud we stopped drinking, but we didn&rsquo;t let him stop.
      We loaded him till he fell out of his chair and laid there snoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We was ready for business now. I said we better pull our boots off, and
      his&rsquo;n too, and not make any noise, then we could pull him and haul him
      around and ransack him without any trouble. So we done it. I set my boots
      and Bud&rsquo;s side by side, where they&rsquo;d be handy. Then we stripped him and
      searched his seams and his pockets and his socks and the inside of his
      boots, and everything, and searched his bundle. Never found any di&rsquo;monds.
      We found the screwdriver, and Hal says, &lsquo;What do you reckon he wanted with
      that?&rsquo; I said I didn&rsquo;t know; but when he wasn&rsquo;t looking I hooked it. At
      last Hal he looked beat and discouraged, and said we&rsquo;d got to give it up.
      That was what I was waiting for. I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s one place we hain&rsquo;t searched.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What place is that?&rsquo; he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;His stomach.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;By gracious, I never thought of that! NOW we&rsquo;re on the homestretch, to a
      dead moral certainty. How&rsquo;ll we manage?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;just stay by him till I turn out and hunt up a drug
      store, and I reckon I&rsquo;ll fetch something that&rsquo;ll make them di&rsquo;monds tired
      of the company they&rsquo;re keeping.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that&rsquo;s the ticket, and with him looking straight at me I slid
      myself into Bud&rsquo;s boots instead of my own, and he never noticed. They was
      just a shade large for me, but that was considerable better than being too
      small. I got my bag as I went a-groping through the hall, and in about a
      minute I was out the back way and stretching up the river road at a
      five-mile gait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not feeling so very bad, neither&mdash;walking on di&rsquo;monds don&rsquo;t have
      no such effect. When I had gone fifteen minutes I says to myself, there&rsquo;s
      more&rsquo;n a mile behind me, and everything quiet. Another five minutes and I
      says there&rsquo;s considerable more land behind me now, and there&rsquo;s a man back
      there that&rsquo;s begun to wonder what&rsquo;s the trouble. Another five and I says
      to myself he&rsquo;s getting real uneasy&mdash;he&rsquo;s walking the floor now.
      Another five, and I says to myself, there&rsquo;s two mile and a half behind me,
      and he&rsquo;s AWFUL uneasy&mdash;beginning to cuss, I reckon. Pretty soon I
      says to myself, forty minutes gone&mdash;he KNOWS there&rsquo;s something up!
      Fifty minutes&mdash;the truth&rsquo;s a-busting on him now! he is reckoning I
      found the di&rsquo;monds whilst we was searching, and shoved them in my pocket
      and never let on&mdash;yes, and he&rsquo;s starting out to hunt for me. He&rsquo;ll
      hunt for new tracks in the dust, and they&rsquo;ll as likely send him down the
      river as up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just then I see a man coming down on a mule, and before I thought I
      jumped into the bush. It was stupid! When he got abreast he stopped and
      waited a little for me to come out; then he rode on again. But I didn&rsquo;t
      feel gay any more. I says to myself I&rsquo;ve botched my chances by that; I
      surely have, if he meets up with Hal Clayton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, about three in the morning I fetched Elexandria and see this
      stern-wheeler laying there, and was very glad, because I felt perfectly
      safe, now, you know. It was just daybreak. I went aboard and got this
      stateroom and put on these clothes and went up in the pilot-house&mdash;to
      watch, though I didn&rsquo;t reckon there was any need of it. I set there and
      played with my di&rsquo;monds and waited and waited for the boat to start, but
      she didn&rsquo;t. You see, they was mending her machinery, but I didn&rsquo;t know
      anything about it, not being very much used to steamboats.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0209}.jpg" alt="{0209}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0209}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to cut the tale short, we never left there till plumb noon; and
      long before that I was hid in this stateroom; for before breakfast I see a
      man coming, away off, that had a gait like Hal Clayton&rsquo;s, and it made me
      just sick. I says to myself, if he finds out I&rsquo;m aboard this boat, he&rsquo;s
      got me like a rat in a trap. All he&rsquo;s got to do is to have me watched, and
      wait&mdash;wait till I slip ashore, thinking he is a thousand miles away,
      then slip after me and dog me to a good place and make me give up the
      di&rsquo;monds, and then he&rsquo;ll&mdash;oh, I know what he&rsquo;ll do! Ain&rsquo;t it awful&mdash;awful!
      And now to think the OTHER one&rsquo;s aboard, too! Oh, ain&rsquo;t it hard luck, boys&mdash;ain&rsquo;t
      it hard! But you&rsquo;ll help save me, WON&rsquo;T you?&mdash;oh, boys, be good to a
      poor devil that&rsquo;s being hunted to death, and save me&mdash;I&rsquo;ll worship
      the very ground you walk on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We turned in and soothed him down and told him we would plan for him and
      help him, and he needn&rsquo;t be so afeard; and so by and by he got to feeling
      kind of comfortable again, and unscrewed his heelplates and held up his
      di&rsquo;monds this way and that, admiring them and loving them; and when the
      light struck into them they WAS beautiful, sure; why, they seemed to kind
      of bust, and snap fire out all around. But all the same I judged he was a
      fool. If I had been him I would a handed the di&rsquo;monds to them pals and got
      them to go ashore and leave me alone. But he was made different. He said
      it was a whole fortune and he couldn&rsquo;t bear the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice we stopped to fix the machinery and laid a good while, once in the
      night; but it wasn&rsquo;t dark enough, and he was afeard to skip. But the third
      time we had to fix it there was a better chance. We laid up at a country
      woodyard about forty mile above Uncle Silas&rsquo;s place a little after one at
      night, and it was thickening up and going to storm. So Jake he laid for a
      chance to slide. We begun to take in wood. Pretty soon the rain come
      a-drenching down, and the wind blowed hard. Of course every boat-hand
      fixed a gunny sack and put it on like a bonnet, the way they do when they
      are toting wood, and we got one for Jake, and he slipped down aft with his
      hand-bag and come tramping forrard just like the rest, and walked ashore
      with them, and when we see him pass out of the light of the torch-basket
      and get swallowed up in the dark, we got our breath again and just felt
      grateful and splendid. But it wasn&rsquo;t for long. Somebody told, I reckon;
      for in about eight or ten minutes them two pals come tearing forrard as
      tight as they could jump and darted ashore and was gone. We waited plumb
      till dawn for them to come back, and kept hoping they would, but they
      never did. We was awful sorry and low-spirited. All the hope we had was
      that Jake had got such a start that they couldn&rsquo;t get on his track, and he
      would get to his brother&rsquo;s and hide there and be safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was going to take the river road, and told us to find out if Brace and
      Jubiter was to home and no strangers there, and then slip out about
      sundown and tell him. Said he would wait for us in a little bunch of
      sycamores right back of Tom&rsquo;s uncle Silas&rsquo;s tobacker field on the river
      road, a lonesome place.
    </p>
    <p>
      We set and talked a long time about his chances, and Tom said he was all
      right if the pals struck up the river instead of down, but it wasn&rsquo;t
      likely, because maybe they knowed where he was from; more likely they
      would go right, and dog him all day, him not suspecting, and kill him when
      it come dark, and take the boots. So we was pretty sorrowful.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. A TRAGEDY IN THE WOODS
    </h2>
    <p>
      WE didn&rsquo;t get done tinkering the machinery till away late in the
      afternoon, and so it was so close to sundown when we got home that we
      never stopped on our road, but made a break for the sycamores as tight as
      we could go, to tell Jake what the delay was, and have him wait till we
      could go to Brace&rsquo;s and find out how things was there. It was getting
      pretty dim by the time we turned the corner of the woods, sweating and
      panting with that long run, and see the sycamores thirty yards ahead of
      us; and just then we see a couple of men run into the bunch and heard two
      or three terrible screams for help. &ldquo;Poor Jake is killed, sure,&rdquo; we says.
      We was scared through and through, and broke for the tobacker field and
      hid there, trembling so our clothes would hardly stay on; and just as we
      skipped in there, a couple of men went tearing by, and into the bunch they
      went, and in a second out jumps four men and took out up the road as tight
      as they could go, two chasing two.
    </p>
    <p>
      We laid down, kind of weak and sick, and listened for more sounds, but
      didn&rsquo;t hear none for a good while but just our hearts. We was thinking of
      that awful thing laying yonder in the sycamores, and it seemed like being
      that close to a ghost, and it give me the cold shudders. The moon come
      a-swelling up out of the ground, now, powerful big and round and bright,
      behind a comb of trees, like a face looking through prison bars, and the
      black shadders and white places begun to creep around, and it was
      miserable quiet and still and night-breezy and graveyardy and scary. All
      of a sudden Tom whispers:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take a person by surprise that way. I&rsquo;m &rsquo;most
      ready to die, anyway, without you doing that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, I tell you. It&rsquo;s something coming out of the sycamores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Tom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible tall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, lordy-lordy! let&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep still&mdash;it&rsquo;s a-coming this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so excited he could hardly get breath enough to whisper. I had to
      look. I couldn&rsquo;t help it. So now we was both on our knees with our chins
      on a fence rail and gazing&mdash;yes, and gasping too. It was coming down
      the road&mdash;coming in the shadder of the trees, and you couldn&rsquo;t see it
      good; not till it was pretty close to us; then it stepped into a bright
      splotch of moonlight and we sunk right down in our tracks&mdash;it was
      Jake Dunlap&rsquo;s ghost! That was what we said to ourselves.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0215}.jpg" alt="{0215}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0215}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      We couldn&rsquo;t stir for a minute or two; then it was gone. We talked about it
      in low voices. Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re mostly dim and smoky, or like they&rsquo;re made out of fog, but this
      one wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;I seen the goggles and the whiskers perfectly plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the very colors in them loud countrified Sunday clothes&mdash;plaid
      breeches, green and black&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cotton velvet westcot, fire-red and yaller squares&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leather straps to the bottoms of the breeches legs and one of them
      hanging unbottoned&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and that hat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a hat for a ghost to wear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You see it was the first season anybody wore that kind&mdash;a black
      stiff-brim stove-pipe, very high, and not smooth, with a round top&mdash;just
      like a sugar-loaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you notice if its hair was the same, Huck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;seems to me I did, then again it seems to me I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t either; but it had its bag along, I noticed that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I. How can there be a ghost-bag, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho! I wouldn&rsquo;t be as ignorant as that if I was you, Huck Finn. Whatever
      a ghost has, turns to ghost-stuff. They&rsquo;ve got to have their things, like
      anybody else. You see, yourself, that its clothes was turned to
      ghost-stuff. Well, then, what&rsquo;s to hender its bag from turning, too? Of
      course it done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was reasonable. I couldn&rsquo;t find no fault with it. Bill Withers and
      his brother Jack come along by, talking, and Jack says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you reckon he was toting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno; but it was pretty heavy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all he could lug. Nigger stealing corn from old Parson Silas, I
      judged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I. And so I allowed I wouldn&rsquo;t let on to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they both laughed, and went on out of hearing. It showed how
      unpopular old Uncle Silas had got to be now. They wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; let a
      nigger steal anybody else&rsquo;s corn and never done anything to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We heard some more voices mumbling along towards us and getting louder,
      and sometimes a cackle of a laugh. It was Lem Beebe and Jim Lane. Jim Lane
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&mdash;Jubiter Dunlap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I reckon so. I seen him spading up some ground along
      about an hour ago, just before sundown&mdash;him and the parson. Said he
      guessed he wouldn&rsquo;t go to-night, but we could have his dog if we wanted
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too tired, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;works so hard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you bet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They cackled at that, and went on by. Tom said we better jump out and tag
      along after them, because they was going our way and it wouldn&rsquo;t be
      comfortable to run across the ghost all by ourselves. So we done it, and
      got home all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night was the second of September&mdash;a Saturday. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t ever
      forget it. You&rsquo;ll see why, pretty soon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. PLANS TO SECURE THE DIAMONDS
    </h2>
    <p>
      WE tramped along behind Jim and Lem till we come to the back stile where
      old Jim&rsquo;s cabin was that he was captivated in, the time we set him free,
      and here come the dogs piling around us to say howdy, and there was the
      lights of the house, too; so we warn&rsquo;t afeard any more, and was going to
      climb over, but Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on; set down here a minute. By George!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matter enough!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t you expecting we would be the first to
      tell the family who it is that&rsquo;s been killed yonder in the sycamores, and
      all about them rapscallions that done it, and about the di&rsquo;monds they&rsquo;ve
      smouched off of the corpse, and paint it up fine, and have the glory of
      being the ones that knows a lot more about it than anybody else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course. It wouldn&rsquo;t be you, Tom Sawyer, if you was to let such a
      chance go by. I reckon it ain&rsquo;t going to suffer none for lack of paint,&rdquo; I
      says, &ldquo;when you start in to scollop the facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; he says, perfectly ca&rsquo;m, &ldquo;what would you say if I was to tell
      you I ain&rsquo;t going to start in at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was astonished to hear him talk so. I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a lie. You ain&rsquo;t in earnest, Tom Sawyer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon see. Was the ghost barefooted?&rdquo;

      &ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t. What of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait&mdash;I&rsquo;ll show you what. Did it have its boots on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I seen them plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I swear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I. Now do you know what that means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Means that them thieves DIDN&rsquo;T GET THE DI&rsquo;MONDS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimminy! What makes you think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t only think it, I know it. Didn&rsquo;t the breeches and goggles and
      whiskers and hand-bag and every blessed thing turn to ghost-stuff?
      Everything it had on turned, didn&rsquo;t it? It shows that the reason its boots
      turned too was because it still had them on after it started to go
      ha&rsquo;nting around, and if that ain&rsquo;t proof that them blatherskites didn&rsquo;t
      get the boots, I&rsquo;d like to know what you&rsquo;d CALL proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Think of that now. I never see such a head as that boy had. Why, I had
      eyes and I could see things, but they never meant nothing to me. But Tom
      Sawyer was different. When Tom Sawyer seen a thing it just got up on its
      hind legs and TALKED to him&mdash;told him everything it knowed. I never
      see such a head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Sawyer,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it again as I&rsquo;ve said it a many a time
      before: I ain&rsquo;t fitten to black your boots. But that&rsquo;s all right&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      neither here nor there. God Almighty made us all, and some He gives eyes
      that&rsquo;s blind, and some He gives eyes that can see, and I reckon it ain&rsquo;t
      none of our lookout what He done it for; it&rsquo;s all right, or He&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; fixed
      it some other way. Go on&mdash;I see plenty plain enough, now, that them
      thieves didn&rsquo;t get way with the di&rsquo;monds. Why didn&rsquo;t they, do you reckon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they got chased away by them other two men before they could pull
      the boots off of the corpse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so! I see it now. But looky here, Tom, why ain&rsquo;t we to go and tell
      about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, can&rsquo;t you see? Look at it. What&rsquo;s a-going to
      happen? There&rsquo;s going to be an inquest in the morning. Them two men will
      tell how they heard the yells and rushed there just in time to not save
      the stranger. Then the jury&rsquo;ll twaddle and twaddle and twaddle, and
      finally they&rsquo;ll fetch in a verdict that he got shot or stuck or busted
      over the head with something, and come to his death by the inspiration of
      God. And after they&rsquo;ve buried him they&rsquo;ll auction off his things for to
      pay the expenses, and then&rsquo;s OUR chance.&rdquo; &ldquo;How, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buy the boots for two dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, it &rsquo;most took my breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My land! Why, Tom, WE&rsquo;LL get the di&rsquo;monds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet. Some day there&rsquo;ll be a big reward offered for them&mdash;a
      thousand dollars, sure. That&rsquo;s our money! Now we&rsquo;ll trot in and see the
      folks. And mind you we don&rsquo;t know anything about any murder, or any
      di&rsquo;monds, or any thieves&mdash;don&rsquo;t you forget that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had to sigh a little over the way he had got it fixed. I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; SOLD them
      di&rsquo;monds&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;for twelve thousand dollars; but I didn&rsquo;t
      say anything. It wouldn&rsquo;t done any good. I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are we going to tell your aunt Sally has made us so long getting
      down here from the village, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll leave that to you,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I reckon you can explain it
      somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was always just that strict and delicate. He never would tell a lie
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We struck across the big yard, noticing this, that, and t&rsquo;other thing that
      was so familiar, and we so glad to see it again, and when we got to the
      roofed big passageway betwixt the double log house and the kitchen part,
      there was everything hanging on the wall just as it used to was, even to
      Uncle Silas&rsquo;s old faded green baize working-gown with the hood to it, and
      raggedy white patch between the shoulders that always looked like somebody
      had hit him with a snowball; and then we lifted the latch and walked in.
      Aunt Sally she was just a-ripping and a-tearing around, and the children
      was huddled in one corner, and the old man he was huddled in the other and
      praying for help in time of need. She jumped for us with joy and tears
      running down her face and give us a whacking box on the ear, and then
      hugged us and kissed us and boxed us again, and just couldn&rsquo;t seem to get
      enough of it, she was so glad to see us; and she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where HAVE you been a-loafing to, you good-for-nothing trash! I&rsquo;ve been
      that worried about you I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. Your traps has been here
      ever so long, and I&rsquo;ve had supper cooked fresh about four times so as to
      have it hot and good when you come, till at last my patience is just plumb
      wore out, and I declare I&mdash;I&mdash;why I could skin you alive! You
      must be starving, poor things!&mdash;set down, set down, everybody; don&rsquo;t
      lose no more time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was good to be there again behind all that noble corn-pone and
      spareribs, and everything that you could ever want in this world. Old
      Uncle Silas he peeled off one of his bulliest old-time blessings, with as
      many layers to it as an onion, and whilst the angels was hauling in the
      slack of it I was trying to study up what to say about what kept us so
      long. When our plates was all loadened and we&rsquo;d got a-going, she asked me,
      and I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see,&mdash;er&mdash;Mizzes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huck Finn! Since when am I Mizzes to you? Have I ever been stingy of
      cuffs or kisses for you since the day you stood in this room and I took
      you for Tom Sawyer and blessed God for sending you to me, though you told
      me four thousand lies and I believed every one of them like a simpleton?
      Call me Aunt Sally&mdash;like you always done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I done it. And I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, me and Tom allowed we would come along afoot and take a smell of
      the woods, and we run across Lem Beebe and Jim Lane, and they asked us to
      go with them blackberrying to-night, and said they could borrow Jubiter
      Dunlap&rsquo;s dog, because he had told them just that minute&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did they see him?&rdquo; says the old man; and when I looked up to see
      how HE come to take an intrust in a little thing like that, his eyes was
      just burning into me, he was that eager. It surprised me so it kind of
      throwed me off, but I pulled myself together again and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was when he was spading up some ground along with you, towards sundown
      or along there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He only said, &ldquo;Um,&rdquo; in a kind of a disappointed way, and didn&rsquo;t take no
      more intrust. So I went on. I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, as I was a-saying&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, you needn&rsquo;t go no furder.&rdquo; It was Aunt Sally. She was boring
      right into me with her eyes, and very indignant. &ldquo;Huck Finn,&rdquo; she says,
      &ldquo;how&rsquo;d them men come to talk about going a-black-berrying in September&mdash;in
      THIS region?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I see I had slipped up, and I couldn&rsquo;t say a word. She waited, still
      a-gazing at me, then she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how&rsquo;d they come to strike that idiot idea of going a-blackberrying in
      the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, m&rsquo;m, they&mdash;er&mdash;they told us they had a lantern, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, SHET up&mdash;do! Looky here; what was they going to do with a dog?&mdash;hunt
      blackberries with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, m&rsquo;m, they&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Tom Sawyer, what kind of a lie are you fixing YOUR mouth to
      contribit to this mess of rubbage? Speak out&mdash;and I warn you before
      you begin, that I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it. You and Huck&rsquo;s been up to
      something you no business to&mdash;I know it perfectly well; I know you,
      BOTH of you. Now you explain that dog, and them blackberries, and the
      lantern, and the rest of that rot&mdash;and mind you talk as straight as a
      string&mdash;do you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom he looked considerable hurt, and says, very dignified:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity if Huck is to be talked to that way, just for making a
      little bit of a mistake that anybody could make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mistake has he made?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, only the mistake of saying blackberries when of course he meant
      strawberries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Sawyer, I lay if you aggravate me a little more, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Sally, without knowing it&mdash;and of course without intending it&mdash;you
      are in the wrong. If you&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; studied natural history the way you ought,
      you would know that all over the world except just here in Arkansaw they
      ALWAYS hunt strawberries with a dog&mdash;and a lantern&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she busted in on him there and just piled into him and snowed him
      under. She was so mad she couldn&rsquo;t get the words out fast enough, and she
      gushed them out in one everlasting freshet. That was what Tom Sawyer was
      after. He allowed to work her up and get her started and then leave her
      alone and let her burn herself out. Then she would be so aggravated with
      that subject that she wouldn&rsquo;t say another word about it, nor let anybody
      else. Well, it happened just so. When she was tuckered out and had to hold
      up, he says, quite ca&rsquo;m:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, all the same, Aunt Sally&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shet up!&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear another word out of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we was perfectly safe, then, and didn&rsquo;t have no more trouble about that
      delay. Tom done it elegant.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. A NIGHT&rsquo;S VIGIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      BENNY she was looking pretty sober, and she sighed some, now and then; but
      pretty soon she got to asking about Mary, and Sid, and Tom&rsquo;s aunt Polly,
      and then Aunt Sally&rsquo;s clouds cleared off and she got in a good humor and
      joined in on the questions and was her lovingest best self, and so the
      rest of the supper went along gay and pleasant. But the old man he didn&rsquo;t
      take any hand hardly, and was absent-minded and restless, and done a
      considerable amount of sighing; and it was kind of heart-breaking to see
      him so sad and troubled and worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by, a spell after supper, come a nigger and knocked on the door and
      put his head in with his old straw hat in his hand bowing and scraping,
      and said his Marse Brace was out at the stile and wanted his brother, and
      was getting tired waiting supper for him, and would Marse Silas please
      tell him where he was? I never see Uncle Silas speak up so sharp and
      fractious before. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I his brother&rsquo;s keeper?&rdquo; And then he kind of wilted together, and
      looked like he wished he hadn&rsquo;t spoken so, and then he says, very gentle:
      &ldquo;But you needn&rsquo;t say that, Billy; I was took sudden and irritable, and I
      ain&rsquo;t very well these days, and not hardly responsible. Tell him he ain&rsquo;t
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when the nigger was gone he got up and walked the floor, backwards and
      forwards, mumbling and muttering to himself and plowing his hands through
      his hair. It was real pitiful to see him. Aunt Sally she whispered to us
      and told us not to take notice of him, it embarrassed him. She said he was
      always thinking and thinking, since these troubles come on, and she
      allowed he didn&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n about half know what he was about when the
      thinking spells was on him; and she said he walked in his sleep
      considerable more now than he used to, and sometimes wandered around over
      the house and even outdoors in his sleep, and if we catched him at it we
      must let him alone and not disturb him. She said she reckoned it didn&rsquo;t do
      him no harm, and may be it done him good. She said Benny was the only one
      that was much help to him these days. Said Benny appeared to know just
      when to try to soothe him and when to leave him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he kept on tramping up and down the floor and muttering, till by and by
      he begun to look pretty tired; then Benny she went and snuggled up to his
      side and put one hand in his and one arm around his waist and walked with
      him; and he smiled down on her, and reached down and kissed her; and so,
      little by little the trouble went out of his face and she persuaded him
      off to his room. They had very petting ways together, and it was uncommon
      pretty to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Sally she was busy getting the children ready for bed; so by and by
      it got dull and tedious, and me and Tom took a turn in the moonlight, and
      fetched up in the watermelon-patch and et one, and had a good deal of
      talk. And Tom said he&rsquo;d bet the quarreling was all Jubiter&rsquo;s fault, and he
      was going to be on hand the first time he got a chance, and see; and if it
      was so, he was going to do his level best to get Uncle Silas to turn him
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so we talked and smoked and stuffed watermelons much as two hours, and
      then it was pretty late, and when we got back the house was quiet and
      dark, and everybody gone to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom he always seen everything, and now he see that the old green baize
      work-gown was gone, and said it wasn&rsquo;t gone when he went out; so he
      allowed it was curious, and then we went up to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could hear Benny stirring around in her room, which was next to ourn,
      and judged she was worried a good deal about her father and couldn&rsquo;t
      sleep. We found we couldn&rsquo;t, neither. So we set up a long time, and smoked
      and talked in a low voice, and felt pretty dull and down-hearted. We
      talked the murder and the ghost over and over again, and got so creepy and
      crawly we couldn&rsquo;t get sleepy nohow and noway.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by, when it was away late in the night and all the sounds was late
      sounds and solemn, Tom nudged me and whispers to me to look, and I done
      it, and there we see a man poking around in the yard like he didn&rsquo;t know
      just what he wanted to do, but it was pretty dim and we couldn&rsquo;t see him
      good. Then he started for the stile, and as he went over it the moon came
      out strong, and he had a long-handled shovel over his shoulder, and we see
      the white patch on the old work-gown. So Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a-walking in his sleep. I wish we was allowed to follow him and see
      where he&rsquo;s going to. There, he&rsquo;s turned down by the tobacker-field. Out of
      sight now. It&rsquo;s a dreadful pity he can&rsquo;t rest no better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We waited a long time, but he didn&rsquo;t come back any more, or if he did he
      come around the other way; so at last we was tuckered out and went to
      sleep and had nightmares, a million of them. But before dawn we was awake
      again, because meantime a storm had come up and been raging, and the
      thunder and lightning was awful, and the wind was a-thrashing the trees
      around, and the rain was driving down in slanting sheets, and the gullies
      was running rivers. Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looky here, Huck, I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing that&rsquo;s mighty curious. Up to
      the time we went out last night the family hadn&rsquo;t heard about Jake Dunlap
      being murdered. Now the men that chased Hal Clayton and Bud Dixon away
      would spread the thing around in a half an hour, and every neighbor that
      heard it would shin out and fly around from one farm to t&rsquo;other and try to
      be the first to tell the news. Land, they don&rsquo;t have such a big thing as
      that to tell twice in thirty year! Huck, it&rsquo;s mighty strange; I don&rsquo;t
      understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So then he was in a fidget for the rain to let up, so we could turn out
      and run across some of the people and see if they would say anything about
      it to us. And he said if they did we must be horribly surprised and
      shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      We was out and gone the minute the rain stopped. It was just broad day
      then. We loafed along up the road, and now and then met a person and
      stopped and said howdy, and told them when we come, and how we left the
      folks at home, and how long we was going to stay, and all that, but none
      of them said a word about that thing; which was just astonishing, and no
      mistake. Tom said he believed if we went to the sycamores we would find
      that body laying there solitary and alone, and not a soul around. Said he
      believed the men chased the thieves so far into the woods that the thieves
      prob&rsquo;ly seen a good chance and turned on them at last, and maybe they all
      killed each other, and so there wasn&rsquo;t anybody left to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      First we knowed, gabbling along that away, we was right at the sycamores.
      The cold chills trickled down my back and I wouldn&rsquo;t budge another step,
      for all Tom&rsquo;s persuading. But he couldn&rsquo;t hold in; he&rsquo;d GOT to see if the
      boots was safe on that body yet. So he crope in&mdash;and the next minute
      out he come again with his eyes bulging he was so excited, and says:
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0233}.jpg" alt="{0233}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0233}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Huck, it&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I WAS astonished! I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, you don&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone, sure. There ain&rsquo;t a sign of it. The ground is trampled some,
      but if there was any blood it&rsquo;s all washed away by the storm, for it&rsquo;s all
      puddles and slush in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last I give in, and went and took a look myself; and it was just as Tom
      said&mdash;there wasn&rsquo;t a sign of a corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dern it,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;the di&rsquo;monds is gone. Don&rsquo;t you reckon the thieves
      slunk back and lugged him off, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like it. It just does. Now where&rsquo;d they hide him, do you reckon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I says, disgusted, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s more I don&rsquo;t care. They&rsquo;ve
      got the boots, and that&rsquo;s all I cared about. He&rsquo;ll lay around these woods
      a long time before I hunt him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom didn&rsquo;t feel no more intrust in him neither, only curiosity to know
      what come of him; but he said we&rsquo;d lay low and keep dark and it wouldn&rsquo;t
      be long till the dogs or somebody rousted him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went back home to breakfast ever so bothered and put out and
      disappointed and swindled. I warn&rsquo;t ever so down on a corpse before.

      CHAPTER VIII. TALKING WITH THE GHOST
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT warn&rsquo;t very cheerful at breakfast. Aunt Sally she looked old and tired
      and let the children snarl and fuss at one another and didn&rsquo;t seem to
      notice it was going on, which wasn&rsquo;t her usual style; me and Tom had a
      plenty to think about without talking; Benny she looked like she hadn&rsquo;t
      had much sleep, and whenever she&rsquo;d lift her head a little and steal a look
      towards her father you could see there was tears in her eyes; and as for
      the old man, his things stayed on his plate and got cold without him
      knowing they was there, I reckon, for he was thinking and thinking all the
      time, and never said a word and never et a bite.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by when it was stillest, that nigger&rsquo;s head was poked in at the
      door again, and he said his Marse Brace was getting powerful uneasy about
      Marse Jubiter, which hadn&rsquo;t come home yet, and would Marse Silas please&mdash;He
      was looking at Uncle Silas, and he stopped there, like the rest of his
      words was froze; for Uncle Silas he rose up shaky and steadied himself
      leaning his fingers on the table, and he was panting, and his eyes was set
      on the nigger, and he kept swallowing, and put his other hand up to his
      throat a couple of times, and at last he got his words started, and says:
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0237}.jpg" alt="{0237}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0237}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he&mdash;does he&mdash;think&mdash;WHAT does he think! Tell him&mdash;tell
      him&mdash;&rdquo; Then he sunk down in his chair limp and weak, and says, so as
      you could hardly hear him: &ldquo;Go away&mdash;go away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nigger looked scared and cleared out, and we all felt&mdash;well, I
      don&rsquo;t know how we felt, but it was awful, with the old man panting there,
      and his eyes set and looking like a person that was dying. None of us
      could budge; but Benny she slid around soft, with her tears running down,
      and stood by his side, and nestled his old gray head up against her and
      begun to stroke it and pet it with her hands, and nodded to us to go away,
      and we done it, going out very quiet, like the dead was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Me and Tom struck out for the woods mighty solemn, and saying how
      different it was now to what it was last summer when we was here and
      everything was so peaceful and happy and everybody thought so much of
      Uncle Silas, and he was so cheerful and simple-hearted and pudd&rsquo;n-headed
      and good&mdash;and now look at him. If he hadn&rsquo;t lost his mind he wasn&rsquo;t
      much short of it. That was what we allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a most lovely day now, and bright and sunshiny; and the further and
      further we went over the hills towards the prairie the lovelier and
      lovelier the trees and flowers got to be and the more it seemed strange
      and somehow wrong that there had to be trouble in such a world as this.
      And then all of a sudden I catched my breath and grabbed Tom&rsquo;s arm, and
      all my livers and lungs and things fell down into my legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; I says. We jumped back behind a bush shivering, and Tom
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Sh!&mdash;don&rsquo;t make a noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was setting on a log right in the edge of a little prairie, thinking. I
      tried to get Tom to come away, but he wouldn&rsquo;t, and I dasn&rsquo;t budge by
      myself. He said we mightn&rsquo;t ever get another chance to see one, and he was
      going to look his fill at this one if he died for it. So I looked too,
      though it give me the fan-tods to do it. Tom he HAD to talk, but he talked
      low. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Jakey, it&rsquo;s got all its things on, just as he said he would. NOW you
      see what we wasn&rsquo;t certain about&mdash;its hair. It&rsquo;s not long now the way
      it was: it&rsquo;s got it cropped close to its head, the way he said he would.
      Huck, I never see anything look any more naturaler than what It does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I neither,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d recognize it anywheres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So would I. It looks perfectly solid and genuwyne, just the way it done
      before it died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we kept a-gazing. Pretty soon Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huck, there&rsquo;s something mighty curious about this one, don&rsquo;t you know? IT
      oughtn&rsquo;t to be going around in the daytime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Tom&mdash;I never heard the like of it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, they don&rsquo;t ever come out only at night&mdash;and then not till
      after twelve. There&rsquo;s something wrong about this one, now you mark my
      words. I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s got any right to be around in the daytime. But
      don&rsquo;t it look natural! Jake was going to play deef and dumb here, so the
      neighbors wouldn&rsquo;t know his voice. Do you reckon it would do that if we
      was to holler at it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lordy, Tom, don&rsquo;t talk so! If you was to holler at it I&rsquo;d die in my
      tracks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry, I ain&rsquo;t going to holler at it. Look, Huck, it&rsquo;s
      a-scratching its head&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this. What&rsquo;s the sense of it scratching its head? There ain&rsquo;t
      anything there to itch; its head is made out of fog or something like
      that, and can&rsquo;t itch. A fog can&rsquo;t itch; any fool knows that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, if it don&rsquo;t itch and can&rsquo;t itch, what in the nation is it
      scratching it for? Ain&rsquo;t it just habit, don&rsquo;t you reckon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I don&rsquo;t. I ain&rsquo;t a bit satisfied about the way this one acts.
      I&rsquo;ve a blame good notion it&rsquo;s a bogus one&mdash;I have, as sure as I&rsquo;m
      a-sitting here. Because, if it&mdash;Huck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU CAN&rsquo;T SEE THE BUSHES THROUGH IT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Tom, it&rsquo;s so, sure! It&rsquo;s as solid as a cow. I sort of begin to think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huck, it&rsquo;s biting off a chaw of tobacker! By George, THEY don&rsquo;t chaw&mdash;they
      hain&rsquo;t got anything to chaw WITH. Huck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a ghost at all. It&rsquo;s Jake Dunlap his own self!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh your granny!&rdquo; I says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huck Finn, did we find any corpse in the sycamores?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or any sign of one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty good reason. Hadn&rsquo;t ever been any corpse there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Tom, you know we heard&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we did&mdash;heard a howl or two. Does that prove anybody was
      killed? Course it don&rsquo;t. And we seen four men run, then this one come
      walking out and we took it for a ghost. No more ghost than you are. It was
      Jake Dunlap his own self, and it&rsquo;s Jake Dunlap now. He&rsquo;s been and got his
      hair cropped, the way he said he would, and he&rsquo;s playing himself for a
      stranger, just the same as he said he would. Ghost? Hum!&mdash;he&rsquo;s as
      sound as a nut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I see it all, and how we had took too much for granted. I was
      powerful glad he didn&rsquo;t get killed, and so was Tom, and we wondered which
      he would like the best&mdash;for us to never let on to know him, or how?
      Tom reckoned the best way would be to go and ask him. So he started; but I
      kept a little behind, because I didn&rsquo;t know but it might be a ghost, after
      all. When Tom got to where he was, he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me and Huck&rsquo;s mighty glad to see you again, and you needn&rsquo;t be afeared
      we&rsquo;ll tell. And if you think it&rsquo;ll be safer for you if we don&rsquo;t let on to
      know you when we run across you, say the word and you&rsquo;ll see you can
      depend on us, and would ruther cut our hands off than get you into the
      least little bit of danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      First off he looked surprised to see us, and not very glad, either; but as
      Tom went on he looked pleasanter, and when he was done he smiled, and
      nodded his head several times, and made signs with his hands, and says:
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0243}.jpg" alt="{0243}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0243}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Goo-goo&mdash;goo-goo,&rdquo; the way deef and dummies does.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then we see some of Steve Nickerson&rsquo;s people coming that lived
      t&rsquo;other side of the prairie, so Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do it elegant; I never see anybody do it better. You&rsquo;re right; play
      it on us, too; play it on us same as the others; it&rsquo;ll keep you in
      practice and prevent you making blunders. We&rsquo;ll keep away from you and let
      on we don&rsquo;t know you, but any time we can be any help, you just let us
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then we loafed along past the Nickersons, and of course they asked if that
      was the new stranger yonder, and where&rsquo;d he come from, and what was his
      name, and which communion was he, Babtis&rsquo; or Methodis&rsquo;, and which
      politics, Whig or Democrat, and how long is he staying, and all them other
      questions that humans always asks when a stranger comes, and animals does,
      too. But Tom said he warn&rsquo;t able to make anything out of deef and dumb
      signs, and the same with goo-gooing. Then we watched them go and bullyrag
      Jake; because we was pretty uneasy for him. Tom said it would take him
      days to get so he wouldn&rsquo;t forget he was a deef and dummy sometimes, and
      speak out before he thought. When we had watched long enough to see that
      Jake was getting along all right and working his signs very good, we
      loafed along again, allowing to strike the schoolhouse about recess time,
      which was a three-mile tramp.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so disappointed not to hear Jake tell about the row in the
      sycamores, and how near he come to getting killed, that I couldn&rsquo;t seem to
      get over it, and Tom he felt the same, but said if we was in Jake&rsquo;s fix we
      would want to go careful and keep still and not take any chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys and girls was all glad to see us again, and we had a real good
      time all through recess. Coming to school the Henderson boys had come
      across the new deef and dummy and told the rest; so all the scholars was
      chuck full of him and couldn&rsquo;t talk about anything else, and was in a
      sweat to get a sight of him because they hadn&rsquo;t ever seen a deef and dummy
      in their lives, and it made a powerful excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom said it was tough to have to keep mum now; said we would be heroes if
      we could come out and tell all we knowed; but after all, it was still more
      heroic to keep mum, there warn&rsquo;t two boys in a million could do it. That
      was Tom Sawyer&rsquo;s idea about it, and I reckoned there warn&rsquo;t anybody could
      better it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. FINDING OF JUBITER DUNLAP
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN the next two or three days Dummy he got to be powerful popular. He went
      associating around with the neighbors, and they made much of him, and was
      proud to have such a rattling curiosity among them. They had him to
      breakfast, they had him to dinner, they had him to supper; they kept him
      loaded up with hog and hominy, and warn&rsquo;t ever tired staring at him and
      wondering over him, and wishing they knowed more about him, he was so
      uncommon and romantic. His signs warn&rsquo;t no good; people couldn&rsquo;t
      understand them and he prob&rsquo;ly couldn&rsquo;t himself, but he done a sight of
      goo-gooing, and so everybody was satisfied, and admired to hear him go it.
      He toted a piece of slate around, and a pencil; and people wrote questions
      on it and he wrote answers; but there warn&rsquo;t anybody could read his
      writing but Brace Dunlap. Brace said he couldn&rsquo;t read it very good, but he
      could manage to dig out the meaning most of the time. He said Dummy said
      he belonged away off somers and used to be well off, but got busted by
      swindlers which he had trusted, and was poor now, and hadn&rsquo;t any way to
      make a living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody praised Brace Dunlap for being so good to that stranger. He let
      him have a little log-cabin all to himself, and had his niggers take care
      of it, and fetch him all the vittles he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dummy was at our house some, because old Uncle Silas was so afflicted
      himself, these days, that anybody else that was afflicted was a comfort to
      him. Me and Tom didn&rsquo;t let on that we had knowed him before, and he didn&rsquo;t
      let on that he had knowed us before. The family talked their troubles out
      before him the same as if he wasn&rsquo;t there, but we reckoned it wasn&rsquo;t any
      harm for him to hear what they said. Generly he didn&rsquo;t seem to notice, but
      sometimes he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, two or three days went along, and everybody got to getting uneasy
      about Jubiter Dunlap. Everybody was asking everybody if they had any idea
      what had become of him. No, they hadn&rsquo;t, they said: and they shook their
      heads and said there was something powerful strange about it. Another and
      another day went by; then there was a report got around that praps he was
      murdered. You bet it made a big stir! Everybody&rsquo;s tongue was clacking away
      after that. Saturday two or three gangs turned out and hunted the woods to
      see if they could run across his remainders. Me and Tom helped, and it was
      noble good times and exciting. Tom he was so brimful of it he couldn&rsquo;t eat
      nor rest. He said if we could find that corpse we would be celebrated, and
      more talked about than if we got drownded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others got tired and give it up; but not Tom Sawyer&mdash;that warn&rsquo;t
      his style. Saturday night he didn&rsquo;t sleep any, hardly, trying to think up
      a plan; and towards daylight in the morning he struck it. He snaked me out
      of bed and was all excited, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, Huck, snatch on your clothes&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got it! Bloodhound!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In two minutes we was tearing up the river road in the dark towards the
      village. Old Jeff Hooker had a bloodhound, and Tom was going to borrow
      him. I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trail&rsquo;s too old, Tom&mdash;and besides, it&rsquo;s rained, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t make any difference, Huck. If the body&rsquo;s hid in the woods
      anywhere around the hound will find it. If he&rsquo;s been murdered and buried,
      they wouldn&rsquo;t bury him deep, it ain&rsquo;t likely, and if the dog goes over the
      spot he&rsquo;ll scent him, sure. Huck, we&rsquo;re going to be celebrated, sure as
      you&rsquo;re born!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was just a-blazing; and whenever he got afire he was most likely to get
      afire all over. That was the way this time. In two minutes he had got it
      all ciphered out, and wasn&rsquo;t only just going to find the corpse&mdash;no,
      he was going to get on the track of that murderer and hunt HIM down, too;
      and not only that, but he was going to stick to him till&mdash;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I
      says, &ldquo;you better find the corpse first; I reckon that&rsquo;s a-plenty for
      to-day. For all we know, there AIN&rsquo;T any corpse and nobody hain&rsquo;t been
      murdered. That cuss could &rsquo;a&rsquo; gone off somers and not been killed at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That graveled him, and he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huck Finn, I never see such a person as you to want to spoil everything.
      As long as YOU can&rsquo;t see anything hopeful in a thing, you won&rsquo;t let
      anybody else. What good can it do you to throw cold water on that corpse
      and get up that selfish theory that there ain&rsquo;t been any murder? None in
      the world. I don&rsquo;t see how you can act so. I wouldn&rsquo;t treat you like that,
      and you know it. Here we&rsquo;ve got a noble good opportunity to make a
      ruputation, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go ahead,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, and I take it all back. I didn&rsquo;t mean
      nothing. Fix it any way you want it. HE ain&rsquo;t any consequence to me. If
      he&rsquo;s killed, I&rsquo;m as glad of it as you are; and if he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said anything about being glad; I only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;m as SORRY as you are. Any way you druther have it, that is
      the way I druther have it. He&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t any druthers ABOUT it, Huck Finn; nobody said anything about
      druthers. And as for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He forgot he was talking, and went tramping along, studying. He begun to
      get excited again, and pretty soon he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huck, it&rsquo;ll be the bulliest thing that ever happened if we find the body
      after everybody else has quit looking, and then go ahead and hunt up the
      murderer. It won&rsquo;t only be an honor to us, but it&rsquo;ll be an honor to Uncle
      Silas because it was us that done it. It&rsquo;ll set him up again, you see if
      it don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Old Jeff Hooker he throwed cold water on the whole business when we
      got to his blacksmith shop and told him what we come for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can take the dog,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but you ain&rsquo;t a-going to find any
      corpse, because there ain&rsquo;t any corpse to find. Everybody&rsquo;s quit looking,
      and they&rsquo;re right. Soon as they come to think, they knowed there warn&rsquo;t no
      corpse. And I&rsquo;ll tell you for why. What does a person kill another person
      for, Tom Sawyer?&mdash;answer me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer up! You ain&rsquo;t no fool. What does he kill him FOR?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sometimes it&rsquo;s for revenge, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait. One thing at a time. Revenge, says you; and right you are. Now who
      ever had anything agin that poor trifling no-account? Who do you reckon
      would want to kill HIM?&mdash;that rabbit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom was stuck. I reckon he hadn&rsquo;t thought of a person having to have a
      REASON for killing a person before, and now he sees it warn&rsquo;t likely
      anybody would have that much of a grudge against a lamb like Jubiter
      Dunlap. The blacksmith says, by and by:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The revenge idea won&rsquo;t work, you see. Well, then, what&rsquo;s next? Robbery?
      B&rsquo;gosh, that must &rsquo;a&rsquo; been it, Tom! Yes, sirree, I reckon we&rsquo;ve struck it
      this time. Some feller wanted his gallus-buckles, and so he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was so funny he busted out laughing, and just went on laughing and
      laughing and laughing till he was &rsquo;most dead, and Tom looked so put out
      and cheap that I knowed he was ashamed he had come, and he wished he
      hadn&rsquo;t. But old Hooker never let up on him. He raked up everything a
      person ever could want to kill another person about, and any fool could
      see they didn&rsquo;t any of them fit this case, and he just made no end of fun
      of the whole business and of the people that had been hunting the body;
      and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they&rsquo;d had any sense they&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; knowed the lazy cuss slid out because
      he wanted a loafing spell after all this work. He&rsquo;ll come pottering back
      in a couple of weeks, and then how&rsquo;ll you fellers feel? But, laws bless
      you, take the dog, and go and hunt his remainders. Do, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he busted out, and had another of them forty-rod laughs of hisn. Tom
      couldn&rsquo;t back down after all this, so he said, &ldquo;All right, unchain him;&rdquo;
       and the blacksmith done it, and we started home and left that old man
      laughing yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lovely dog. There ain&rsquo;t any dog that&rsquo;s got a lovelier disposition
      than a bloodhound, and this one knowed us and liked us. He capered and
      raced around ever so friendly, and powerful glad to be free and have a
      holiday; but Tom was so cut up he couldn&rsquo;t take any intrust in him, and
      said he wished he&rsquo;d stopped and thought a minute before he ever started on
      such a fool errand. He said old Jeff Hooker would tell everybody, and we&rsquo;d
      never hear the last of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we loafed along home down the back lanes, feeling pretty glum and not
      talking. When we was passing the far corner of our tobacker field we heard
      the dog set up a long howl in there, and we went to the place and he was
      scratching the ground with all his might, and every now and then canting
      up his head sideways and fetching another howl.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0251}.jpg" alt="{0251}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0251}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      It was a long square, the shape of a grave; the rain had made it sink down
      and show the shape. The minute we come and stood there we looked at one
      another and never said a word. When the dog had dug down only a few inches
      he grabbed something and pulled it up, and it was an arm and a sleeve. Tom
      kind of gasped out, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away, Huck&mdash;it&rsquo;s found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I just felt awful. We struck for the road and fetched the first men that
      come along. They got a spade at the crib and dug out the body, and you
      never see such an excitement. You couldn&rsquo;t make anything out of the face,
      but you didn&rsquo;t need to. Everybody said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Jubiter; it&rsquo;s his clothes, to the last rag!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some rushed off to spread the news and tell the justice of the peace and
      have an inquest, and me and Tom lit out for the house. Tom was all afire
      and &rsquo;most out of breath when we come tearing in where Uncle Silas and Aunt
      Sally and Benny was. Tom sung out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me and Huck&rsquo;s found Jubiter Dunlap&rsquo;s corpse all by ourselves with a
      bloodhound, after everybody else had quit hunting and given it up; and if
      it hadn&rsquo;t a been for us it never WOULD &rsquo;a&rsquo; been found; and he WAS murdered
      too&mdash;they done it with a club or something like that; and I&rsquo;m going
      to start in and find the murderer, next, and I bet I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Sally and Benny sprung up pale and astonished, but Uncle Silas fell
      right forward out of his chair on to the floor and groans out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God, you&rsquo;ve found him NOW!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE ARREST OF UNCLE SILAS
    </h2>
    <p>
      THEM awful words froze us solid. We couldn&rsquo;t move hand or foot for as much
      as half a minute. Then we kind of come to, and lifted the old man up and
      got him into his chair, and Benny petted him and kissed him and tried to
      comfort him, and poor old Aunt Sally she done the same; but, poor things,
      they was so broke up and scared and knocked out of their right minds that
      they didn&rsquo;t hardly know what they was about. With Tom it was awful; it
      &rsquo;most petrified him to think maybe he had got his uncle into a thousand
      times more trouble than ever, and maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t ever happened if he
      hadn&rsquo;t been so ambitious to get celebrated, and let the corpse alone the
      way the others done. But pretty soon he sort of come to himself again and
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Silas, don&rsquo;t you say another word like that. It&rsquo;s dangerous, and
      there ain&rsquo;t a shadder of truth in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Sally and Benny was thankful to hear him say that, and they said the
      same; but the old man he wagged his head sorrowful and hopeless, and the
      tears run down his face, and he says;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I done it; poor Jubiter, I done it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was dreadful to hear him say it. Then he went on and told about it, and
      said it happened the day me and Tom come&mdash;along about sundown. He
      said Jubiter pestered him and aggravated him till he was so mad he just
      sort of lost his mind and grabbed up a stick and hit him over the head
      with all his might, and Jubiter dropped in his tracks. Then he was scared
      and sorry, and got down on his knees and lifted his head up, and begged
      him to speak and say he wasn&rsquo;t dead; and before long he come to, and when
      he see who it was holding his head, he jumped like he was &rsquo;most scared to
      death, and cleared the fence and tore into the woods, and was gone. So he
      hoped he wasn&rsquo;t hurt bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But laws,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;it was only just fear that gave him that last little
      spurt of strength, and of course it soon played out and he laid down in
      the bush, and there wasn&rsquo;t anybody to help him, and he died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the old man cried and grieved, and said he was a murderer and the
      mark of Cain was on him, and he had disgraced his family and was going to
      be found out and hung. But Tom said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you ain&rsquo;t going to be found out. You DIDN&rsquo;T kill him. ONE lick
      wouldn&rsquo;t kill him. Somebody else done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I done it&mdash;nobody else. Who else had anything
      against him? Who else COULD have anything against him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up kind of like he hoped some of us could mention somebody that
      could have a grudge against that harmless no-account, but of course it
      warn&rsquo;t no use&mdash;he HAD us; we couldn&rsquo;t say a word. He noticed that,
      and he saddened down again, and I never see a face so miserable and so
      pitiful to see. Tom had a sudden idea, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But hold on!&mdash;somebody BURIED him. Now who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shut off sudden. I knowed the reason. It give me the cold shudders when
      he said them words, because right away I remembered about us seeing Uncle
      Silas prowling around with a long-handled shovel away in the night that
      night. And I knowed Benny seen him, too, because she was talking about it
      one day. The minute Tom shut off he changed the subject and went to
      begging Uncle Silas to keep mum, and the rest of us done the same, and
      said he MUST, and said it wasn&rsquo;t his business to tell on himself, and if
      he kept mum nobody would ever know; but if it was found out and any harm
      come to him it would break the family&rsquo;s hearts and kill them, and yet
      never do anybody any good. So at last he promised. We was all of us more
      comfortable, then, and went to work to cheer up the old man. We told him
      all he&rsquo;d got to do was to keep still, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be long till the
      whole thing would blow over and be forgot. We all said there wouldn&rsquo;t
      anybody ever suspect Uncle Silas, nor ever dream of such a thing, he being
      so good and kind, and having such a good character; and Tom says, cordial
      and hearty, he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, just look at it a minute; just consider. Here is Uncle Silas, all
      these years a preacher&mdash;at his own expense; all these years doing
      good with all his might and every way he can think of&mdash;at his own
      expense, all the time; always been loved by everybody, and respected;
      always been peaceable and minding his own business, the very last man in
      this whole deestrict to touch a person, and everybody knows it. Suspect
      HIM? Why, it ain&rsquo;t any more possible than&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By authority of the State of Arkansaw, I arrest you for the murder of
      Jubiter Dunlap!&rdquo; shouts the sheriff at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was awful. Aunt Sally and Benny flung themselves at Uncle Silas,
      screaming and crying, and hugged him and hung to him, and Aunt Sally said
      go away, she wouldn&rsquo;t ever give him up, they shouldn&rsquo;t have him, and the
      niggers they come crowding and crying to the door and&mdash;well, I
      couldn&rsquo;t stand it; it was enough to break a person&rsquo;s heart; so I got out.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took him up to the little one-horse jail in the village, and we all
      went along to tell him good-bye; and Tom was feeling elegant, and says to
      me, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a most noble good time and heaps of danger some dark night
      getting him out of there, Huck, and it&rsquo;ll be talked about everywheres and
      we will be celebrated;&rdquo; but the old man busted that scheme up the minute
      he whispered to him about it. He said no, it was his duty to stand
      whatever the law done to him, and he would stick to the jail plumb through
      to the end, even if there warn&rsquo;t no door to it. It disappointed Tom and
      graveled him a good deal, but he had to put up with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he felt responsible and bound to get his uncle Silas free; and he told
      Aunt Sally, the last thing, not to worry, because he was going to turn in
      and work night and day and beat this game and fetch Uncle Silas out
      innocent; and she was very loving to him and thanked him and said she
      knowed he would do his very best. And she told us to help Benny take care
      of the house and the children, and then we had a good-bye cry all around
      and went back to the farm, and left her there to live with the jailer&rsquo;s
      wife a month till the trial in October.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. TOM SAWYER DISCOVERS THE MURDERERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      WELL, that was a hard month on us all. Poor Benny, she kept up the best
      she could, and me and Tom tried to keep things cheerful there at the
      house, but it kind of went for nothing, as you may say. It was the same up
      at the jail. We went up every day to see the old people, but it was awful
      dreary, because the old man warn&rsquo;t sleeping much, and was walking in his
      sleep considerable and so he got to looking fagged and miserable, and his
      mind got shaky, and we all got afraid his troubles would break him down
      and kill him. And whenever we tried to persuade him to feel cheerfuler, he
      only shook his head and said if we only knowed what it was to carry around
      a murderer&rsquo;s load in your heart we wouldn&rsquo;t talk that way. Tom and all of
      us kept telling him it WASN&rsquo;T murder, but just accidental killing! but it
      never made any difference&mdash;it was murder, and he wouldn&rsquo;t have it any
      other way. He actu&rsquo;ly begun to come out plain and square towards trial
      time and acknowledge that he TRIED to kill the man. Why, that was awful,
      you know. It made things seem fifty times as dreadful, and there warn&rsquo;t no
      more comfort for Aunt Sally and Benny. But he promised he wouldn&rsquo;t say a
      word about his murder when others was around, and we was glad of that.
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0259}.jpg" alt="{0259}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0259}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      Tom Sawyer racked the head off of himself all that month trying to plan
      some way out for Uncle Silas, and many&rsquo;s the night he kept me up &rsquo;most all
      night with this kind of tiresome work, but he couldn&rsquo;t seem to get on the
      right track no way. As for me, I reckoned a body might as well give it up,
      it all looked so blue and I was so downhearted; but he wouldn&rsquo;t. He stuck
      to the business right along, and went on planning and thinking and
      ransacking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      So at last the trial come on, towards the middle of October, and we was
      all in the court. The place was jammed, of course. Poor old Uncle Silas,
      he looked more like a dead person than a live one, his eyes was so hollow
      and he looked so thin and so mournful. Benny she set on one side of him
      and Aunt Sally on the other, and they had veils on, and was full of
      trouble. But Tom he set by our lawyer, and had his finger in everywheres,
      of course. The lawyer let him, and the judge let him. He &rsquo;most took the
      business out of the lawyer&rsquo;s hands sometimes; which was well enough,
      because that was only a mud-turtle of a back-settlement lawyer and didn&rsquo;t
      know enough to come in when it rains, as the saying is.
    </p>
    <p>
      They swore in the jury, and then the lawyer for the prostitution got up
      and begun. He made a terrible speech against the old man, that made him
      moan and groan, and made Benny and Aunt Sally cry. The way HE told about
      the murder kind of knocked us all stupid it was so different from the old
      man&rsquo;s tale. He said he was going to prove that Uncle Silas was SEEN to
      kill Jubiter Dunlap by two good witnesses, and done it deliberate, and
      SAID he was going to kill him the very minute he hit him with the club;
      and they seen him hide Jubiter in the bushes, and they seen that Jubiter
      was stone-dead. And said Uncle Silas come later and lugged Jubiter down
      into the tobacker field, and two men seen him do it. And said Uncle Silas
      turned out, away in the night, and buried Jubiter, and a man seen him at
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I says to myself, poor old Uncle Silas has been lying about it because he
      reckoned nobody seen him and he couldn&rsquo;t bear to break Aunt Sally&rsquo;s heart
      and Benny&rsquo;s; and right he was: as for me, I would &rsquo;a&rsquo; lied the same way,
      and so would anybody that had any feeling, to save them such misery and
      sorrow which THEY warn&rsquo;t no ways responsible for. Well, it made our lawyer
      look pretty sick; and it knocked Tom silly, too, for a little spell, but
      then he braced up and let on that he warn&rsquo;t worried&mdash;but I knowed he
      WAS, all the same. And the people&mdash;my, but it made a stir amongst
      them!
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0263}.jpg" alt="{0263}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0263}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      And when that lawyer was done telling the jury what he was going to prove,
      he set down and begun to work his witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, he called a lot of them to show that there was bad blood betwixt
      Uncle Silas and the diseased; and they told how they had heard Uncle Silas
      threaten the diseased, at one time and another, and how it got worse and
      worse and everybody was talking about it, and how diseased got afraid of
      his life, and told two or three of them he was certain Uncle Silas would
      up and kill him some time or another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom and our lawyer asked them some questions; but it warn&rsquo;t no use, they
      stuck to what they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, they called up Lem Beebe, and he took the stand. It come into my
      mind, then, how Lem and Jim Lane had come along talking, that time, about
      borrowing a dog or something from Jubiter Dunlap; and that brought up the
      blackberries and the lantern; and that brought up Bill and Jack Withers,
      and how they passed by, talking about a nigger stealing Uncle Silas&rsquo;s
      corn; and that fetched up our old ghost that come along about the same
      time and scared us so&mdash;and here HE was too, and a privileged
      character, on accounts of his being deef and dumb and a stranger, and they
      had fixed him a chair inside the railing, where he could cross his legs
      and be comfortable, whilst the other people was all in a jam so they
      couldn&rsquo;t hardly breathe. So it all come back to me just the way it was
      that day; and it made me mournful to think how pleasant it was up to then,
      and how miserable ever since.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     LEM BEEBE, sworn, said&mdash;&ldquo;I was a-coming along, that day,
     second of September, and Jim Lane was with me, and it was
     towards sundown, and we heard loud talk, like quarrelling,
     and we was very close, only the hazel bushes between (that&rsquo;s
     along the fence); and we heard a voice say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve told you
     more&rsquo;n once I&rsquo;d kill you,&rsquo; and knowed it was this prisoner&rsquo;s
     voice; and then we see a club come up above the bushes and
     down out of sight again, and heard a smashing thump and then
     a groan or two: and then we crope soft to where we could
     see, and there laid Jupiter Dunlap dead, and this prisoner
     standing over him with the club; and the next he hauled the
     dead man into a clump of bushes and hid him, and then we
     stooped low, to be out of sight, and got away.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Well, it was awful. It kind of froze everybody&rsquo;s blood to hear it, and the
      house was &rsquo;most as still whilst he was telling it as if there warn&rsquo;t
      nobody in it. And when he was done, you could hear them gasp and sigh, all
      over the house, and look at one another the same as to say, &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it
      perfectly terrible&mdash;ain&rsquo;t it awful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now happened a thing that astonished me. All the time the first witnesses
      was proving the bad blood and the threats and all that, Tom Sawyer was
      alive and laying for them; and the minute they was through, he went for
      them, and done his level best to catch them in lies and spile their
      testimony. But now, how different. When Lem first begun to talk, and never
      said anything about speaking to Jubiter or trying to borrow a dog off of
      him, he was all alive and laying for Lem, and you could see he was getting
      ready to cross-question him to death pretty soon, and then I judged him
      and me would go on the stand by and by and tell what we heard him and Jim
      Lane say. But the next time I looked at Tom I got the cold shivers. Why,
      he was in the brownest study you ever see&mdash;miles and miles away. He
      warn&rsquo;t hearing a word Lem Beebe was saying; and when he got through he was
      still in that brown-study, just the same. Our lawyer joggled him, and then
      he looked up startled, and says, &ldquo;Take the witness if you want him. Lemme
      alone&mdash;I want to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, that beat me. I couldn&rsquo;t understand it. And Benny and her mother&mdash;oh,
      they looked sick, they was so troubled. They shoved their veils to one
      side and tried to get his eye, but it warn&rsquo;t any use, and I couldn&rsquo;t get
      his eye either. So the mud-turtle he tackled the witness, but it didn&rsquo;t
      amount to nothing; and he made a mess of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they called up Jim Lane, and he told the very same story over again,
      exact. Tom never listened to this one at all, but set there thinking and
      thinking, miles and miles away. So the mud-turtle went in alone again and
      come out just as flat as he done before. The lawyer for the prostitution
      looked very comfortable, but the judge looked disgusted. You see, Tom was
      just the same as a regular lawyer, nearly, because it was Arkansaw law for
      a prisoner to choose anybody he wanted to help his lawyer, and Tom had had
      Uncle Silas shove him into the case, and now he was botching it and you
      could see the judge didn&rsquo;t like it much. All that the mud-turtle got out
      of Lem and Jim was this: he asked them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go and tell what you saw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We was afraid we would get mixed up in it ourselves. And we was just
      starting down the river a-hunting for all the week besides; but as soon as
      we come back we found out they&rsquo;d been searching for the body, so then we
      went and told Brace Dunlap all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saturday night, September 9th.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge he spoke up and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sheriff, arrest these two witnesses on suspicions of being
      accessionary after the fact to the murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer for the prostitution jumps up all excited, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honor! I protest against this extraordi&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0269}.jpg" alt="{0269}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0269}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Set down!&rdquo; says the judge, pulling his bowie and laying it on his pulpit.
      &ldquo;I beg you to respect the Court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he done it. Then he called Bill Withers.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     BILL WITHERS, sworn, said: &ldquo;I was coming along about sundown,
     Saturday, September 2d, by the prisoner&rsquo;s field, and my
     brother Jack was with me and we seen a man toting off
     something heavy on his back and allowed it was a nigger
     stealing corn; we couldn&rsquo;t see distinct; next we made out that
     it was one man carrying another; and the way it hung, so kind
     of limp, we judged it was somebody that was drunk; and by the
     man&rsquo;s walk we said it was Parson Silas, and we judged he had
     found Sam Cooper drunk in the road, which he was always trying
     to reform him, and was toting him out of danger.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It made the people shiver to think of poor old Uncle Silas toting off the
      diseased down to the place in his tobacker field where the dog dug up the
      body, but there warn&rsquo;t much sympathy around amongst the faces, and I heard
      one cuss say &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the coldest blooded work I ever struck, lugging a
      murdered man around like that, and going to bury him like a animal, and
      him a preacher at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom he went on thinking, and never took no notice; so our lawyer took the
      witness and done the best he could, and it was plenty poor enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Jack Withers he come on the stand and told the same tale, just like
      Bill done.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after him comes Brace Dunlap, and he was looking very mournful, and
      most crying; and there was a rustle and a stir all around, and everybody
      got ready to listen, and lots of the women folks said, &ldquo;Poor cretur, poor
      cretur,&rdquo; and you could see a many of them wiping their eyes.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     BRACE DUNLAP, sworn, said: &ldquo;I was in considerable trouble a
     long time about my poor brother, but I reckoned things warn&rsquo;t
     near so bad as he made out, and I couldn&rsquo;t make myself believe
     anybody would have the heart to hurt a poor harmless cretur
     like that&rdquo;&mdash;[by jings, I was sure I seen Tom give a kind of a
     faint little start, and then look disappointed again]&mdash;&ldquo;and
     you know I COULDN&rsquo;T think a preacher would hurt him&mdash;it warn&rsquo;t
     natural to think such an onlikely thing&mdash;so I never paid much
     attention, and now I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t ever, ever forgive myself; for if
     I had a done different, my poor brother would be with me this
     day, and not laying yonder murdered, and him so harmless.&rdquo; He
     kind of broke down there and choked up, and waited to get his
     voice; and people all around said the most pitiful things, and
     women cried; and it was very still in there, and solemn, and
     old Uncle Silas, poor thing, he give a groan right out so
     everybody heard him.  Then Brace he went on, &ldquo;Saturday,
     September 2d, he didn&rsquo;t come home to supper. By-and-by I got a
     little uneasy, and one of my niggers went over to this
     prisoner&rsquo;s place, but come back and said he warn&rsquo;t there.  So
     I got uneasier and uneasier, and couldn&rsquo;t rest.  I went to
     bed, but I couldn&rsquo;t sleep; and turned out, away late in the
     night, and went wandering over to this prisoner&rsquo;s place and
     all around about there a good while, hoping I would run across
     my poor brother, and never knowing he was out of his troubles
     and gone to a better shore&mdash;&rdquo; So he broke down and choked up
     again, and most all the women was crying now.  Pretty soon he
     got another start and says: &ldquo;But it warn&rsquo;t no use; so at last
     I went home and tried to get some sleep, but couldn&rsquo;t. Well,
     in a day or two everybody was uneasy, and they got to talking
     about this prisoner&rsquo;s threats, and took to the idea, which I
     didn&rsquo;t take no stock in, that my brother was murdered so they
     hunted around and tried to find his body, but couldn&rsquo;t and
     give it up.  And so I reckoned he was gone off somers to have
     a little peace, and would come back to us when his troubles
     was kind of healed.  But late Saturday night, the 9th, Lem
     Beebe and Jim Lane come to my house and told me all&mdash;told me
     the whole awful &rsquo;sassination, and my heart was broke. And THEN
     I remembered something that hadn&rsquo;t took no hold of me at the
     time, because reports said this prisoner had took to walking
     in his sleep and doing all kind of things of no consequence,
     not knowing what he was about.  I will tell you what that
     thing was that come back into my memory. Away late that awful
     Saturday night when I was wandering around about this
     prisoner&rsquo;s place, grieving and troubled, I was down by the
     corner of the tobacker-field and I heard a sound like digging
     in a gritty soil; and I crope nearer and peeped through the
     vines that hung on the rail fence and seen this prisoner
     SHOVELING&mdash;shoveling with a long-handled shovel&mdash;heaving earth
     into a big hole that was most filled up; his back was to me,
     but it was bright moonlight and I knowed him by his old green
     baize work-gown with a splattery white patch in the middle of
     the back like somebody had hit him with a snowball. HE WAS
     BURYING THE MAN HE&rsquo;D MURDERED!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And he slumped down in his chair crying and sobbing, and &rsquo;most everybody
      in the house busted out wailing, and crying, and saying, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s awful&mdash;awful&mdash;horrible!&rdquo;
       and there was a most tremendous excitement, and you couldn&rsquo;t hear yourself
      think; and right in the midst of it up jumps old Uncle Silas, white as a
      sheet, and sings out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;IT&rsquo;S TRUE, EVERY WORD&mdash;I MURDERED HIM IN COLD BLOOD!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By Jackson, it petrified them! People rose up wild all over the house,
      straining and staring for a better look at him, and the judge was
      hammering with his mallet and the sheriff yelling &ldquo;Order&mdash;order in
      the court&mdash;order!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And all the while the old man stood there a-quaking and his eyes
      a-burning, and not looking at his wife and daughter, which was clinging to
      him and begging him to keep still, but pawing them off with his hands and
      saying he WOULD clear his black soul from crime, he WOULD heave off this
      load that was more than he could bear, and he WOULDN&rsquo;T bear it another
      hour! And then he raged right along with his awful tale, everybody
      a-staring and gasping, judge, jury, lawyers, and everybody, and Benny and
      Aunt Sally crying their hearts out. And by George, Tom Sawyer never looked
      at him once! Never once&mdash;just set there gazing with all his eyes at
      something else, I couldn&rsquo;t tell what. And so the old man raged right
      along, pouring his words out like a stream of fire:
    </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0273}.jpg" alt="{0273}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0273}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;I killed him! I am guilty! But I never had the notion in my life to hurt
      him or harm him, spite of all them lies about my threatening him, till the
      very minute I raised the club&mdash;then my heart went cold!&mdash;then
      the pity all went out of it, and I struck to kill! In that one moment all
      my wrongs come into my mind; all the insults that that man and the
      scoundrel his brother, there, had put upon me, and how they laid in
      together to ruin me with the people, and take away my good name, and DRIVE
      me to some deed that would destroy me and my family that hadn&rsquo;t ever done
      THEM no harm, so help me God! And they done it in a mean revenge&mdash;for
      why? Because my innocent pure girl here at my side wouldn&rsquo;t marry that
      rich, insolent, ignorant coward, Brace Dunlap, who&rsquo;s been sniveling here
      over a brother he never cared a brass farthing for&mdash;&rdquo; [I see Tom give
      a jump and look glad THIS time, to a dead certainty] &ldquo;&mdash;and in that
      moment I&rsquo;ve told you about, I forgot my God and remembered only my heart&rsquo;s
      bitterness, God forgive me, and I struck to kill. In one second I was
      miserably sorry&mdash;oh, filled with remorse; but I thought of my poor
      family, and I MUST hide what I&rsquo;d done for their sakes; and I did hide that
      corpse in the bushes; and presently I carried it to the tobacker field;
      and in the deep night I went with my shovel and buried it where&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up jumps Tom and shouts:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NOW, I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; and waves his hand, oh, ever so fine and starchy,
      towards the old man, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set down! A murder WAS done, but you never had no hand in it!&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0275}.jpg" alt="{0275}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0275}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      Well, sir, you could a heard a pin drop. And the old man he sunk down kind
      of bewildered in his seat and Aunt Sally and Benny didn&rsquo;t know it, because
      they was so astonished and staring at Tom with their mouths open and not
      knowing what they was about. And the whole house the same. I never seen
      people look so helpless and tangled up, and I hain&rsquo;t ever seen eyes bug
      out and gaze without a blink the way theirn did. Tom says, perfectly ca&rsquo;m:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honor, may I speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, yes&mdash;go on!&rdquo; says the judge, so astonished and mixed
      up he didn&rsquo;t know what he was about hardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Tom he stood there and waited a second or two&mdash;that was for to
      work up an &ldquo;effect,&rdquo; as he calls it&mdash;then he started in just as ca&rsquo;m
      as ever, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For about two weeks now there&rsquo;s been a little bill sticking on the front
      of this courthouse offering two thousand dollars reward for a couple of
      big di&rsquo;monds&mdash;stole at St. Louis. Them di&rsquo;monds is worth twelve
      thousand dollars. But never mind about that till I get to it. Now about
      this murder. I will tell you all about it&mdash;how it happened&mdash;who
      done it&mdash;every DEtail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You could see everybody nestle now, and begin to listen for all they was
      worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man here, Brace Dunlap, that&rsquo;s been sniveling so about his dead
      brother that YOU know he never cared a straw for, wanted to marry that
      young girl there, and she wouldn&rsquo;t have him. So he told Uncle Silas he
      would make him sorry. Uncle Silas knowed how powerful he was, and how
      little chance he had against such a man, and he was scared and worried,
      and done everything he could think of to smooth him over and get him to be
      good to him: he even took his no-account brother Jubiter on the farm and
      give him wages and stinted his own family to pay them; and Jubiter done
      everything his brother could contrive to insult Uncle Silas, and fret and
      worry him, and try to drive Uncle Silas into doing him a hurt, so as to
      injure Uncle Silas with the people. And it done it. Everybody turned
      against him and said the meanest kind of things about him, and it graduly
      broke his heart&mdash;yes, and he was so worried and distressed that often
      he warn&rsquo;t hardly in his right mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, on that Saturday that we&rsquo;ve had so much trouble about, two of these
      witnesses here, Lem Beebe and Jim Lane, come along by where Uncle Silas
      and Jubiter Dunlap was at work&mdash;and that much of what they&rsquo;ve said is
      true, the rest is lies. They didn&rsquo;t hear Uncle Silas say he would kill
      Jubiter; they didn&rsquo;t hear no blow struck; they didn&rsquo;t see no dead man, and
      they didn&rsquo;t see Uncle Silas hide anything in the bushes. Look at them now&mdash;how
      they set there, wishing they hadn&rsquo;t been so handy with their tongues;
      anyway, they&rsquo;ll wish it before I get done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That same Saturday evening Bill and Jack Withers DID see one man lugging
      off another one. That much of what they said is true, and the rest is
      lies. First off they thought it was a nigger stealing Uncle Silas&rsquo;s corn&mdash;you
      notice it makes them look silly, now, to find out somebody overheard them
      say that. That&rsquo;s because they found out by and by who it was that was
      doing the lugging, and THEY know best why they swore here that they took
      it for Uncle Silas by the gait&mdash;which it WASN&rsquo;T, and they knowed it
      when they swore to that lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man out in the moonlight DID see a murdered person put under ground in
      the tobacker field&mdash;but it wasn&rsquo;t Uncle Silas that done the burying.
      He was in his bed at that very time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, before I go on, I want to ask you if you&rsquo;ve ever noticed this:
      that people, when they&rsquo;re thinking deep, or when they&rsquo;re worried, are most
      always doing something with their hands, and they don&rsquo;t know it, and don&rsquo;t
      notice what it is their hands are doing, some stroke their chins; some
      stroke their noses; some stroke up UNDER their chin with their hand; some
      twirl a chain, some fumble a button, then there&rsquo;s some that draws a figure
      or a letter with their finger on their cheek, or under their chin or on
      their under lip. That&rsquo;s MY way. When I&rsquo;m restless, or worried, or thinking
      hard, I draw capital V&rsquo;s on my cheek or on my under lip or under my chin,
      and never anything BUT capital V&rsquo;s&mdash;and half the time I don&rsquo;t notice
      it and don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was odd. That is just what I do; only I make an O. And I could see
      people nodding to one another, same as they do when they mean &ldquo;THAT&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, I&rsquo;ll go on. That same Saturday&mdash;no, it was the night
      before&mdash;there was a steamboat laying at Flagler&rsquo;s Landing, forty
      miles above here, and it was raining and storming like the nation. And
      there was a thief aboard, and he had them two big di&rsquo;monds that&rsquo;s
      advertised out here on this courthouse door; and he slipped ashore with
      his hand-bag and struck out into the dark and the storm, and he was
      a-hoping he could get to this town all right and be safe. But he had two
      pals aboard the boat, hiding, and he knowed they was going to kill him the
      first chance they got and take the di&rsquo;monds; because all three stole them,
      and then this fellow he got hold of them and skipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he hadn&rsquo;t been gone more&rsquo;n ten minutes before his pals found it
      out, and they jumped ashore and lit out after him. Prob&rsquo;ly they burnt
      matches and found his tracks. Anyway, they dogged along after him all day
      Saturday and kept out of his sight; and towards sundown he come to the
      bunch of sycamores down by Uncle Silas&rsquo;s field, and he went in there to
      get a disguise out of his hand-bag and put it on before he showed himself
      here in the town&mdash;and mind you he done that just a little after the
      time that Uncle Silas was hitting Jubiter Dunlap over the head with a club&mdash;for
      he DID hit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the minute the pals see that thief slide into the bunch of sycamores,
      they jumped out of the bushes and slid in after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They fell on him and clubbed him to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for all he screamed and howled so, they never had no mercy on him,
      but clubbed him to death. And two men that was running along the road
      heard him yelling that way, and they made a rush into the sycamore bunch&mdash;which
      was where they was bound for, anyway&mdash;and when the pals saw them they
      lit out and the two new men after them a-chasing them as tight as they
      could go. But only a minute or two&mdash;then these two new men slipped
      back very quiet into the sycamores.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;THEN what did they do? I will tell you what they done. They found where
      the thief had got his disguise out of his carpet-sack to put on; so one of
      them strips and puts on that disguise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom waited a little here, for some more &ldquo;effect&rdquo;&mdash;then he says, very
      deliberate:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man that put on that dead man&rsquo;s disguise was&mdash;JUBITER DUNLAP!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; everybody shouted, all over the house, and old Uncle Silas
      he looked perfectly astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was Jubiter Dunlap. Not dead, you see. Then they pulled off the
      dead man&rsquo;s boots and put Jubiter Dunlap&rsquo;s old ragged shoes on the corpse
      and put the corpse&rsquo;s boots on Jubiter Dunlap. Then Jubiter Dunlap stayed
      where he was, and the other man lugged the dead body off in the twilight;
      and after midnight he went to Uncle Silas&rsquo;s house, and took his old green
      work-robe off of the peg where it always hangs in the passage betwixt the
      house and the kitchen and put it on, and stole the long-handled shovel and
      went off down into the tobacker field and buried the murdered man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and stood half a minute. Then&mdash;&ldquo;And who do you reckon the
      murdered man WAS? It was&mdash;JAKE Dunlap, the long-lost burglar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the man that buried him was&mdash;BRACE Dunlap, his brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who do you reckon is this mowing idiot here that&rsquo;s letting on all
      these weeks to be a deef and dumb stranger? It&rsquo;s&mdash;JUBITER Dunlap!&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0281}.jpg" alt="{0281}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0281}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      My land, they all busted out in a howl, and you never see the like of that
      excitement since the day you was born. And Tom he made a jump for Jubiter
      and snaked off his goggles and his false whiskers, and there was the
      murdered man, sure enough, just as alive as anybody! And Aunt Sally and
      Benny they went to hugging and crying and kissing and smothering old Uncle
      Silas to that degree he was more muddled and confused and mushed up in his
      mind than he ever was before, and that is saying considerable. And next,
      people begun to yell:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Sawyer! Tom Sawyer! Shut up everybody, and let him go on! Go on, Tom
      Sawyer!&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0285}.jpg" alt="{0285}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0285}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      Which made him feel uncommon bully, for it was nuts for Tom Sawyer to be a
      public character that-away, and a hero, as he calls it. So when it was all
      quiet, he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t much left, only this. When that man there, Bruce Dunlap, had
      most worried the life and sense out of Uncle Silas till at last he plumb
      lost his mind and hit this other blatherskite, his brother, with a club, I
      reckon he seen his chance. Jubiter broke for the woods to hide, and I
      reckon the game was for him to slide out, in the night, and leave the
      country. Then Brace would make everybody believe Uncle Silas killed him
      and hid his body somers; and that would ruin Uncle Silas and drive HIM out
      of the country&mdash;hang him, maybe; I dunno. But when they found their
      dead brother in the sycamores without knowing him, because he was so
      battered up, they see they had a better thing; disguise BOTH and bury Jake
      and dig him up presently all dressed up in Jubiter&rsquo;s clothes, and hire Jim
      Lane and Bill Withers and the others to swear to some handy lies&mdash;which
      they done. And there they set, now, and I told them they would be looking
      sick before I got done, and that is the way they&rsquo;re looking now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, me and Huck Finn here, we come down on the boat with the thieves,
      and the dead one told us all about the di&rsquo;monds, and said the others would
      murder him if they got the chance; and we was going to help him all we
      could. We was bound for the sycamores when we heard them killing him in
      there; but we was in there in the early morning after the storm and
      allowed nobody hadn&rsquo;t been killed, after all. And when we see Jubiter
      Dunlap here spreading around in the very same disguise Jake told us HE was
      going to wear, we thought it was Jake his own self&mdash;and he was
      goo-gooing deef and dumb, and THAT was according to agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, me and Huck went on hunting for the corpse after the others quit,
      and we found it. And was proud, too; but Uncle Silas he knocked us crazy
      by telling us HE killed the man. So we was mighty sorry we found the body,
      and was bound to save Uncle Silas&rsquo;s neck if we could; and it was going to
      be tough work, too, because he wouldn&rsquo;t let us break him out of prison the
      way we done with our old nigger Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I done everything I could the whole month to think up some way to save
      Uncle Silas, but I couldn&rsquo;t strike a thing. So when we come into court
      to-day I come empty, and couldn&rsquo;t see no chance anywheres. But by and by I
      had a glimpse of something that set me thinking&mdash;just a little wee
      glimpse&mdash;only that, and not enough to make sure; but it set me
      thinking hard&mdash;and WATCHING, when I was only letting on to think; and
      by and by, sure enough, when Uncle Silas was piling out that stuff about
      HIM killing Jubiter Dunlap, I catched that glimpse again, and this time I
      jumped up and shut down the proceedings, because I KNOWED Jubiter Dunlap
      was a-setting here before me. I knowed him by a thing which I seen him do&mdash;and
      I remembered it. I&rsquo;d seen him do it when I was here a year ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped then, and studied a minute&mdash;laying for an &ldquo;effect&rdquo;&mdash;I
      knowed it perfectly well. Then he turned off like he was going to leave
      the platform, and says, kind of lazy and indifferent:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I believe that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why, you never heard such a howl!&mdash;and it come from the whole house:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What WAS it you seen him do? Stay where you are, you little devil! You
      think you are going to work a body up till his mouth&rsquo;s a-watering and stop
      there? What WAS it he done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was it, you see&mdash;he just done it to get an &ldquo;effect&rdquo;; you
      couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; pulled him off of that platform with a yoke of oxen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t anything much,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I seen him looking a little
      excited when he found Uncle Silas was actually fixing to hang himself for
      a murder that warn&rsquo;t ever done; and he got more and more nervous and
      worried, I a-watching him sharp but not seeming to look at him&mdash;and
      all of a sudden his hands begun to work and fidget, and pretty soon his
      left crept up and HIS FINGER DRAWED A CROSS ON HIS CHEEK, and then I HAD
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, then they ripped and howled and stomped and clapped their hands till
      Tom Sawyer was that proud and happy he didn&rsquo;t know what to do with
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the judge he looked down over his pulpit and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy, did you SEE all the various details of this strange conspiracy
      and tragedy that you&rsquo;ve been describing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, your honor, I didn&rsquo;t see any of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t see any of them! Why, you&rsquo;ve told the whole history straight
      through, just the same as if you&rsquo;d seen it with your eyes. How did you
      manage that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom says, kind of easy and comfortable:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just noticing the evidence and piecing this and that together, your
      honor; just an ordinary little bit of detective work; anybody could &rsquo;a&rsquo; 
      done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the kind! Not two in a million could &rsquo;a&rsquo; done it. You are a
      very remarkable boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they let go and give Tom another smashing round, and he&mdash;well,
      he wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; sold out for a silver mine. Then the judge says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you certain you&rsquo;ve got this curious history straight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, your honor. Here is Brace Dunlap&mdash;let him deny his share
      of it if he wants to take the chance; I&rsquo;ll engage to make him wish he
      hadn&rsquo;t said anything...... Well, you see HE&rsquo;S pretty quiet. And his
      brother&rsquo;s pretty quiet, and them four witnesses that lied so and got paid
      for it, they&rsquo;re pretty quiet. And as for Uncle Silas, it ain&rsquo;t any use for
      him to put in his oar, I wouldn&rsquo;t believe him under oath!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, sir, that fairly made them shout; and even the judge he let go and
      laughed. Tom he was just feeling like a rainbow. When they was done
      laughing he looks up at the judge and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honor, there&rsquo;s a thief in this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. And he&rsquo;s got them twelve-thousand-dollar di&rsquo;monds on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By gracious, but it made a stir! Everybody went shouting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is him? which is him? p&rsquo;int him out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the judge says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Point him out, my lad. Sheriff, you will arrest him. Which one is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This late dead man here&mdash;Jubiter Dunlap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there was another thundering let-go of astonishment and excitement;
      but Jubiter, which was astonished enough before, was just fairly putrified
      with astonishment this time. And he spoke up, about half crying, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now THAT&rsquo;S a lie. Your honor, it ain&rsquo;t fair; I&rsquo;m plenty bad enough
      without that. I done the other things&mdash;Brace he put me up to it, and
      persuaded me, and promised he&rsquo;d make me rich, some day, and I done it, and
      I&rsquo;m sorry I done it, and I wisht I hadn&rsquo;t; but I hain&rsquo;t stole no di&rsquo;monds,
      and I hain&rsquo;t GOT no di&rsquo;monds; I wisht I may never stir if it ain&rsquo;t so. The
      sheriff can search me and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honor, it wasn&rsquo;t right to call him a thief, and I&rsquo;ll let up on that
      a little. He did steal the di&rsquo;monds, but he didn&rsquo;t know it. He stole them
      from his brother Jake when he was laying dead, after Jake had stole them
      from the other thieves; but Jubiter didn&rsquo;t know he was stealing them; and
      he&rsquo;s been swelling around here with them a month; yes, sir, twelve
      thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of di&rsquo;monds on him&mdash;all that riches, and
      going around here every day just like a poor man. Yes, your honor, he&rsquo;s
      got them on him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge spoke up and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search him, sheriff.&rdquo;
     </p>

<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0205}.jpg" alt="{0205}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0205}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      Well, sir, the sheriff he ransacked him high and low, and everywhere:
      searched his hat, socks, seams, boots, everything&mdash;and Tom he stood
      there quiet, laying for another of them effects of hisn. Finally the
      sheriff he give it up, and everybody looked disappointed, and Jubiter
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, now! what&rsquo;d I tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the judge says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears you were mistaken this time, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Tom took an attitude and let on to be studying with all his might,
      and scratching his head. Then all of a sudden he glanced up chipper, and
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, now I&rsquo;ve got it! I&rsquo;d forgot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Which was a lie, and I knowed it. Then he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will somebody be good enough to lend me a little small screwdriver? There
      was one in your brother&rsquo;s hand-bag that you smouched, Jubiter, but I
      reckon you didn&rsquo;t fetch it with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t want it, and I give it away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you didn&rsquo;t know what it was for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jubiter had his boots on again, by now, and when the thing Tom wanted was
      passed over the people&rsquo;s heads till it got to him, he says to Jubiter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put up your foot on this chair.&rdquo; And he kneeled down and begun to unscrew
      the heel-plate, everybody watching; and when he got that big di&rsquo;mond out
      of that boot-heel and held it up and let it flash and blaze and squirt
      sunlight everwhichaway, it just took everybody&rsquo;s breath; and Jubiter he
      looked so sick and sorry you never see the like of it. And when Tom held
      up the other di&rsquo;mond he looked sorrier than ever. Land! he was thinking
      how he would &rsquo;a&rsquo; skipped out and been rich and independent in a foreign
      land if he&rsquo;d only had the luck to guess what the screwdriver was in the
      carpet-bag for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it was a most exciting time, take it all around, and Tom got cords
      of glory. The judge took the di&rsquo;monds, and stood up in his pulpit, and
      cleared his throat, and shoved his spectacles back on his head, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep them and notify the owners; and when they send for them it will
      be a real pleasure to me to hand you the two thousand dollars, for you&rsquo;ve
      earned the money&mdash;yes, and you&rsquo;ve earned the deepest and most
      sincerest thanks of this community besides, for lifting a wronged and
      innocent family out of ruin and shame, and saving a good and honorable man
      from a felon&rsquo;s death, and for exposing to infamy and the punishment of the
      law a cruel and odious scoundrel and his miserable creatures!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, sir, if there&rsquo;d been a brass band to bust out some music, then, it
      would &rsquo;a&rsquo; been just the perfectest thing I ever see, and Tom Sawyer he
      said the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the sheriff he nabbed Brace Dunlap and his crowd, and by and by next
      month the judge had them up for trial and jailed the whole lot. And
      everybody crowded back to Uncle Silas&rsquo;s little old church, and was ever so
      loving and kind to him and the family and couldn&rsquo;t do enough for them; and
      Uncle Silas he preached them the blamedest jumbledest idiotic sermons you
      ever struck, and would tangle you up so you couldn&rsquo;t find your way home in
      daylight; but the people never let on but what they thought it was the
      clearest and brightest and elegantest sermons that ever was; and they
      would set there and cry, for love and pity; but, by George, they give me
      the jim-jams and the fan-tods and caked up what brains I had, and turned
      them solid; but by and by they loved the old man&rsquo;s intellects back into
      him again, and he was as sound in his skull as ever he was, which ain&rsquo;t no
      flattery, I reckon. And so the whole family was as happy as birds, and
      nobody could be gratefuler and lovinger than what they was to Tom Sawyer;
      and the same to me, though I hadn&rsquo;t done nothing. And when the two
      thousand dollars come, Tom give half of it to me, and never told anybody
      so, which didn&rsquo;t surprise me, because I knowed him.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
